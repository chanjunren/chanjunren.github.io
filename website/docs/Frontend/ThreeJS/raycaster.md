# Why Convert Mouse Coordinates
- Native JavaScript Coordinates: In a web browser, the mouse position is typically given in pixels relative to the top-left corner of the browser window. The x-coordinate increases to the right, and the y-coordinate increases downwards.
- WebGL/Three.js Coordinate System: In WebGL and libraries like Three.js, the coordinate system is different. It's normalized to a range from -1 to 1. The center of the screen is (0, 0), the far left is (-1), the far right is (1), the top is (1) and the bottom is (-1). This system is used for calculations like raycasting.
