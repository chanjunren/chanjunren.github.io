# strengthening
Strengthening ensures you can actively control your joints through their full range of motion, which improves both stability and functional movement patterns. It also:

- **Activates Weak Muscles**: Imbalances often cause tightness; strengthening weak muscles can reduce overcompensation and tension in other areas.
- **Improves Joint Stability**: Strong muscles help stabilize joints, especially in dynamic or weight-bearing movements.
- **Encourages Functional Range of Motion**: Mobility is more than just achieving a stretch; it's about being able to use that range effectively in daily activities, sports, or exercises.
