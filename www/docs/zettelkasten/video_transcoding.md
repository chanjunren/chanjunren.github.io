# video_transcoding
```ad-tldr
Create multiple versions of video content optimized for different use cases
```

## Why Transcode?
- **Device Compatibility**: Different devices support different formats
- **Network Adaptation**: Multiple bitrates for varying connection speeds
- **Storage Optimization**: Smaller files for mobile users
- **User Experience**: Smooth playback without buffering
## Quality Ladder Strategy
```
Original: 1080p @ 5000kbps (high quality source)
- 1080p @ 3000kbps (high-end devices)
- 720p @ 1500kbps (standard quality)
- 480p @ 800kbps (mobile/slow connections)
- 360p @ 400kbps (very slow connections)
```
## Transcoding Timing
### Eager
> Transcode immediately after upload
- Pro: Fast delivery, better user experience
- Con: Higher storage costs, processing overhead
### Lazy
> Transcode on first request
- Pro: Lower storage costs, only popular content processed
- Con: Slow first viewing experience
### Smart
> Transcode based on predicted popularity
- Pro: Balance of cost and performance
- Con: Complex prediction logic needed
## Format Considerations
- H.264: Universal compatibility (use this as baseline)
- H.265/HEVC: Better compression, newer devices
- AV1: Future codec, best compression
- Container: MP4 for broad compatibility
