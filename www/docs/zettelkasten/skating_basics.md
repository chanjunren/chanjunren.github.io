- Keep your body facing forward, and let your arms open naturally.
- Engage your core to stay stable.
- Open the front leg to the same side, and use the hip joint to rotate as much as possible so that both knees point sideways and stay aligned.
- When shifting your weight outward, move your center of gravity over the rear leg.
- As your front leg lifts and moves backward, perform a crossover motion, then open the other leg outward again.
