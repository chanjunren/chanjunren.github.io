| Feature           | [[b_tree]]                               | [[b_plus_tree]]                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Data storage      | Both internal and leaf nodes             | Only leaf nodes                      |
| Search efficiency | Slower due to potential multiple levelss | Faster as all searches end at leaves |
| Sequential access | Not inherently supported                 | Efficient due to linked leaves       |
| Complexity        | More complex insertions / deletions      | Simpler insertions and deletions     |
## Applications
- Indexing operations in relational database management systems (RDBMS)
