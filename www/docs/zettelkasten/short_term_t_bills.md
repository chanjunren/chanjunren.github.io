## What are T-Bills?
- **Treasury Bills** - Short-term government debt securities
- Issued by MAS on behalf of Singapore Government
- **Zero-coupon bonds** - bought at discount, mature at face value
- Profit = Face value - Purchase price

## Key Features
- **Tenures**: 6 months or 1 year only
- **Minimum**: S$1,000 (in S$1,000 multiples)
- **Maximum**: No limit (subject to auction allocation)
- **Risk**: Virtually zero (government-backed)
- **Tax**: Returns are **tax-free** for individuals
- **Liquidity**: Must hold to maturity (no early redemption)

## How T-Bills Work
- **Auction-based pricing** - yields determined by market demand
- **Discount purchase**: Buy below face value (e.g., pay S$980 for S$1,000 bill)
- **Maturity payout**: Receive full face value at maturity
- **Return calculation**: (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price √ó (365/days to maturity)

## Bidding Types
**Non-Competitive Bid:**
- Accept whatever yield the auction determines
- Higher chance of getting allocation
- Good for retail investors

**Competitive Bid:**
- Specify your desired yield
- Only get allocation if your bid is at/below cut-off yield
- Risk of no allocation if bid too low

## Purchase Options
- **Cash**: Via bank ATM/internet banking (DBS/POSB, OCBC, UOB)
- **SRS**: Through SRS operator's internet banking
- **CPF-OA**: In-person application at bank's main branch

## Pros & Cons
‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Government guarantee (zero default risk)
- Tax-free returns
- Market-determined competitive yields
- Short commitment period

‚ùå **Cons:**
- **No liquidity** - must hold to maturity
- **Auction risk** - may not get allocation
- **Opportunity cost** - locked in for 6-12 months
- **Secondary market** - low liquidity, price fluctuation risk

## Current Context (2024-2025)
- Yields typically range 3-4% depending on market conditions
- Higher yields than SSBs for similar timeframes
- Popular during rising interest rate environments

## Strategy Considerations
- **Cash parking**: Good for short-term excess cash (6-12 months)
- **Laddering**: Stagger maturities for regular cash flow
- **Rate timing**: Consider interest rate cycle when choosing tenure
- **Emergency fund**: Not suitable due to lack of liquidity
