# functional_programming

- **Core Idea:** FP treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. It emphasizes immutability and pure functions.
    
- **Key Principles:**
    
    - **Pure Functions:** Functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
        
    - **Immutability:** Data is never modified after creation; instead, new data structures are created.
        
    - **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions:** Functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, or assigned to variables.
        
    - **Recursion:** Iteration is achieved through recursion instead of loops.
        
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - Data transformation and processing (e.g., data pipelines, analytics).
        
    - Concurrent and parallel programming (due to immutability and lack of side effects).
        
- **Examples:** Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, Scala, JavaScript (with FP techniques).
