# apache_ant
Build automation tool written in Java

## Core Capabilities
### File operations
- Copy, move, delete files and directories.
- Create, modify, and extract archives (ZIP, JAR, TAR, etc.).
- Filter files to replace tokens with values (e.g., configuration properties).
### Compilation
- Compile Java source code.
- Execute programs or scripts.

### Deployment
- Copy files to a remote server.
- Deploy web applications to application servers (e.g., Tomcat).

### Testing
- Run unit tests and integration tests.
- Generate reports on test results.

### Other Tasks
- Send emails.
- Generate documentation (e.g., Javadoc).
- Check for the existence of files or properties.
- Execute SQL statements.

## Key Advantages
- **Platform Independence:** Ant is written in Java, making it runnable on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Extensibility:** You can create custom tasks or use third-party "Antlibs" (libraries of Ant tasks) to extend its functionality.
- **XML-Based Build Files:** Ant uses XML files (`build.xml`) to define the build process, making it easy to read and modify.
- **Control Flow:** Ant supports conditional logic, loops, and other control structures for creating complex build workflows.
- **Dependency Management:** You can combine Ant with Apache Ivy for managing external libraries and dependencies.

## How Ant Works
### Targets and Tasks
- Ant build files are organized into `targets` 
-  Each target represents a specific task or set of tasks (e.g., "compile," "test," "deploy").
    
### Dependencies
Targets can have dependencies on other targets, creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that defines the order of execution.
    
### Task Execution
- When you run Ant, you specify a target to execute
- Ant then analyzes the dependencies and executes the necessary tasks in the correct order.
    
## Example
```xml
<project name="MyProject" default="compile">
  <target name="compile">
    <javac srcdir="src" destdir="build/classes" />
  </target>

  <target name="jar" depends="compile">
    <jar destfile="build/myproject.jar" basedir="build/classes" />
  </target>
</project>
```

This simple build file defines two targets:
- `compile` compiles the Java code in the `src` directory, and
- `jar` creates a JAR file (dependent on the `compile` target).
