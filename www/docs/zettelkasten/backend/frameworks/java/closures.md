# closures

- Essentially blocks of code that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, and executed later
- They capture and remember the environment in which they were created (including variables), making them very versatile.

## Groovy example

```groovy
def greeting = { name -> println "Hello, $name!" } // Define a closure

greeting("Alice") // Call the closure
```

- Used extensively in:
    - **Builders:** To construct complex objects (like XML or HTML).
    - **Collections:** To transform or filter elements.
    - **Testing Frameworks:** To set up test data and conditions.
