> **HTAP** = **Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing**

It’s a **database architecture** that **supports both [[oltp]] and [[olap]] workloads** **on the same system**, often in real time — **without needing ETL**.

## 🚀 Why HTAP is a Big Deal

|🔍 Traditional|🔥 HTAP|
|---|---|
|OLTP + OLAP are separate|Unified system|
|ETL delays|Real-time sync|
|High infra complexity|Simpler architecture|
|Costly duplication|Single source of truth|

## 🧩 How Does HTAP Work?

HTAP systems often:
1. Store **data once**, but in formats suited for both workloads
2. Use **multi-engine architectures** (row store + column store)
3. Separate compute for **isolation** (no interference)
4. Leverage **MVCC**, **HTAP schedulers**, or **replication** to optimize for both use cases

## 🛠️ Real-World Examples

| System                  | HTAP Capabilities                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TiDB** (PingCAP)      | OLTP (MySQL-like) + OLAP (TiFlash)                                  |
| **SingleStore**         | Unified row/column engine                                           |
| **CockroachDB**         | OLTP + some analytical support                                      |
| **MySQL + HeatWave**    | HTAP via in-memory analytics                                        |
| **ClickHouse**          | OLAP-focused, but moving toward HTAP with insert speed improvements |
| **DorisDB / StarRocks** | Emerging HTAP-style performance                                     |

## ✅ Benefits
- 💡 Real-time analytics on live data
- 🚫 No need for ETL pipelines
- 🔒 Strong consistency for both workloads
- 💸 Lower infra & ops cost

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Still a maturing field — not all HTAP systems are equal
- Balancing latency (OLTP) with throughput (OLAP)
- Can be harder to tune for both workloads simultaneously
