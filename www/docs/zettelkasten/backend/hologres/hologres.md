> Fully compatible with PostgreSQL, which allows reuse of PostgreSQL-based tools and queries.

2. Real-Time Data Warehousing
> Designed to ingest, update, and analyze **petabytes of data with low latency**.

3.  OLAP & Ad Hoc Queries
> Optimized for **analytical processing** and **fine-grained, on-the-fly data queries**.

4. Deep Integration with Alibaba Cloud Ecosystem
> Works seamlessly with **MaxCompute, Flink, Spark, and DataWorks** to offer full-stack data processing


```ad-note
Key use cases:
- Real-time analytics, marketing profiling, audience grouping
- Fine-grained analysis and self-service BI
- Real-time risk management and ID mapping
```

## Key Features Summary

### Flexible Querying and Analysis
**Support for Multiple Storage Models**
- [[row_oriented_storage]]
- [[column_oriented_storage]]
- Hybrid storage
> depending on the query and performance requirements.

**Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)**
> SQL statements are distributed across clusters for faster execution and resource efficiency.

**Optimized for Diverse Query Types**
> Handles simple, complex, and ad hoc queries efficiently.

### Sub-Second Interactive Analysis
**Parallel Computing via MPP Architecture**
> Utilizes scalable, parallel query execution.

**Vectorization and AliORC Format**
> Optimized storage and I/O throughput for large-scale SSD-based storage.

### High-Performance Point Queries
**Primary Key Indexing**
> Enables **high-throughput, low-latency queries** for operations like ID lookups and dimension table joins.

**Performance Optimization**
> Offers up to **10x performance improvements over open-source alternatives**.

### Federated Queries and Data Lake Acceleration
Integrates with MaxCompute and OSS
> allowing you to **accelerate queries by 5-10x** through optimized metadata imports and external tables.

Supports **real-time synchronization of millions of rows per second** from MaxCompute

### Semi-Structured Data Analysis
**Native JSON/JSONB Support**
> Efficient storage and querying of JSON data similar to native column stores

### Real-Time High-Concurrency Data Writes
Seamless integration with **Flink and Spark**
> High-throughput real-time ingestion

Supports real-time updates with atomicity and isolation guarantees

### Event-Driven Development
**Binary Log Parsing**
> End-to-end real-time pipelines via **Flink consumption of update events** for minimal data latency

### Real-Time Materialized Views
Automatically updates aggregate views **immediately after source data changes** 
> enabling real-time aggregations.
