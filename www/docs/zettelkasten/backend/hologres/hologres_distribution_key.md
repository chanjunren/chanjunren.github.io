# hologres_distribution_key

## When to use
- GROUP BY / JOIN operations frequently performed
- Prevent [[data_skew]]

```ad-tldr
The distribution key helps evenly distribute data on compute nodes

This significantly improves computing and query performance
```

## Introduction
- Use `distribution_key` to specify distribution policy
- Entries with same `distribution_key` distributed to same shard

```sql
-- Syntax supported in Hologres V2.1 and later
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (...) WITH (distribution_key = '[<columnName>[,...]]');

-- Syntax supported in all Hologres versions
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (...);
call set_table_property('<table_name>', 'distribution_key', '[<columnName>[,...]]');
COMMIT;
```

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| table_name    | The name of the table for which you want to specify the distribution key. |
| columnName    | The name of the column that you want to specify as the distribution key.  |

## Effects
### Improved computing performance
- Parallel computing can be performed on different shards
- This improves computing performance

### Improved queries per second (QPS)
- Can filter data based on the `distribution_key`
- Filter set:  Hologres scans data only in the shards that meet filter conditions
- Filter not set: Hologres performs computing on all shards
> Decreases the QPS
    
### Improved join efficiency
- Hologres can perform local join operations when tables belong to the same table group and share the same distribution key
- This means the join is executed within the same segment (shard)
- Eliminates the need for costly data shuffling or transfers across the networ

> This greatly improves execution efficiency

## Usage notes
> Rules for specifying a distribution key

1. Specify the columns in which data is evenly distributed as distribution key columns
	- Otherwise, data skew issues may occur due to uneven allocation of computing resources > Reduces query efficiency
	- Read [Query the shard allocation among workers](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/user-guide/query-the-shard-allocation-among-workers#task-2255914)  for troubleshooting data skew issues
    
2. Specify the columns on which the¬†`GROUP BY`¬†operation is frequently performed as distribution key columns.
	- In scenarios where you want to create and join tables, specify the **join columns as the distribution key** columns of the tables
	- This way, the system can implement a local join, which helps prevent data shuffling
	- The tables that you want to join must belong to the **same table group**
    
3. Recommended to specify **no more than two columns** as distribution key columns for a table
	- If any of the distribution key columns is not hit during queries, data shuffling may occur

4. You can specify one column as a distribution key or more columns to constitute a distribution key 
	- Single column:
		- Do not include extra spaces in the statement that you execute to specify the distribution key
	- Multiple columns:
		- Separate the columns with commas (,) and do not include extra spaces in the statement
		- Order of the columns does not affect data layout and query performance
5. After you specify a primary key for a table, the distribution key must be the same as the primary key or a subset of the primary key
	- For a table with a primary key, a distribution key is required because entries with the same distribution key value must be distributed to the same shard
	- If you do not specify a distribution key, the primary key is used as the distribution key by default
    

## Limits

1. Distribution key can only be specified during table creation
	- If you want to modify the distribution key for an existing table, you must create another table and import data to the table
    
2. Cannot modify values of distribution key columns
	- If you want to modify the values, you must create another table.
    
3. Columns of the following data types cannot be specified as distribution key columns
	- FLOAT
	- DOUBLE
	- NUMERIC
	- ARRAY
	- JSON
	- Other complex data types
??? Whut
    
4. For a table without a primary key, you can determine whether to specify a distribution key based on your business requirements
	- If you do not specify a distribution key, data is randomly distributed to different shards
	- In Hologres V1.3.28 and later, a distribution key must be specified, and the following sample statement is forbidden:
   
5. For a distribution key column, ¬†`null`¬†value is regarded as an empty string 
	-  Displayed as double quotation marks¬†`(‚Äú‚Äù)`
	-  It indicates that no distribution key is specified.
    

## How it works

### Specify a distribution key
- data in the table is distributed to shards based on the distribution key by using the¬†`Hash(distribution_key)%shard_count`¬†algorithm
- The returned result is the shard ID
- Entries with the same distribution key value are distributed to the same shard

    ```sql
    -- Specify Column a as a distribution key column. Hologres performs a hash operation on the values in Column a and performs a modulo operation on the results. The returned result is the shard ID. Entries with the same distribution key value are distributed to the same shard.
    CREATE TABLE tbl (
        a int NOT NULL,
        b text NOT NULL
    )
    WITH (
        distribution_key = 'a'
    );
    
    -- Specify Column a and Column b as distribution key columns. Hologres performs a hash operation on the values in Column a and Column b and performs a modulo operation on the results. The returned result is the shard ID. Entries with the same distribution key value are distributed to the same shard.
    CREATE TABLE tbl (
        a int NOT NULL,
        b text NOT NULL
    )
    WITH (
        distribution_key = 'a,b'
    );
    ```
    
- Syntax supported in all Hologres versions:
    
    ```sql
    -- Specify Column a as a distribution key column. Hologres performs a hash operation on the values in Column a and performs a modulo operation on the hash results. The returned result is the shard ID. Entries with the same distribution key value are distributed to the same shard.
    begin;
    create table tbl (
    a int not null,
    b text not null
    );
    call set_table_property('tbl', 'distribution_key', 'a');
    commit;
    
    -- Specify Columns a and b to constitute a distribution key. Hologres performs a hash operation on the values in Columns a and b and performs a modulo operation on the hash results. The returned result is the shard ID. Entries with the same distribution key value are distributed to the same shard.
    begin;
    create table tbl (
      a int not null,
      b text not null
    );
    call set_table_property('tbl', 'distribution_key', 'a,b');
    commit;
                                
    ```
    

The following figure shows the data distribution.![ËÆæÁΩÆdistribution key](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0837526761/p529866.png)If you specify a distribution key, make sure that the data of the distribution key columns is evenly distributed. The shard count in Hologres is proportional to the number of worker nodes. For more information, see¬†[Basic concepts](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/user-guide/basic-concepts#concept-2172430). If you specify columns in which data is unevenly distributed as distribution key columns, data is distributed to some shards and most computing resources are consumed by some worker nodes. As a result, long tails occur. alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/user-guide/query-the-shard-allocation-among-workers#task-2255914).

### Do not specify a distribution key

If you do not specify a distribution key, data is randomly distributed to shards. The entries with the same value may be distributed to different shards. Examples:

```sql
-- Do not specify a distribution key.
begin;
create table tbl (
a int not null,
b text not null
);
commit;
```

The following figure shows the data distribution.![‰∏çËÆæÁΩÆdistribution key](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0837526761/p529859.png)

### Specify a distribution key for a table on which the GROUP BY operation is frequently performed

After you specify a distribution key for a table, the entries with the same distribution key value are distributed to the same shard. If the GROUP BY operation is performed, the data is redistributed based on the specified distribution key during computing. You can specify the columns on which the GROUP BY operation is frequently performed as distribution key columns. In this case, the same data in the same shard is aggregated. This reduces data redistribution among the shards and improves query performance. Examples:

- Syntax supported in Hologres V2.1 and later:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE agg_tbl (
        a int NOT NULL,
        b int NOT NULL
    )
    WITH (
        distribution_key = 'a'
    );
    
    -- Perform an aggregate query on Column a:
    select a,sum(b) from agg_tbl group by a;
    ```
    
- Syntax supported in all Hologres versions:
    
    ```sql
    begin;
    create table agg_tbl (
    a int not null,
    b int not null
    );
    call set_table_property('agg_tbl', 'distribution_key', 'a');
    commit;
    
    -- Perform an aggregate query on Column a:
    select a,sum(b) from agg_tbl group by a;
    ```
    

You can query the execution plan by executing the Explain statement. The following figure shows that the execution plan does not contain the¬†`redistribution`¬†operator. This indicates that no data is redistributed.![QUERY PLAN](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8888515761/p529875.png)

### Specify distribution keys for two tables that you want to join

- Specify both join columns as distribution keys.
    
    If the join columns of the two tables are specified as distribution keys for the tables, the entries with the same distribution key value are distributed to the same shard. This way, a local join operation can be performed to join the two tables. This accelerates data queries. Examples:
    
    - Execute the following DDL statements to create two tables:
        
        - Syntax supported in Hologres V2.1 and later:
            
            ```sql
            -- Data in the table named tbl1 is distributed based on Column a, whereas data in the table named tbl2 is distributed based on Column c. If you join the two tables by using the a=c condition, the matched data in the two tables is distributed to the same shard. This way, a local join operation is performed on the tables to accelerate data queries.
            BEGIN;
            CREATE TABLE tbl1 (
                a int NOT NULL,
                b text NOT NULL
            )
            WITH (
                distribution_key = 'a'
            );
            CREATE TABLE tbl2 (
                c int NOT NULL,
                d text NOT NULL
            )
            WITH (
                distribution_key = 'c'
            );
            COMMIT;
            ```
            
        - Syntax supported in all Hologres versions:
            
            ```sql
            -- Data in the table named tbl1 is distributed based on Column a, whereas data in the table named tbl2 is distributed based on Column c. If you join the two tables by using the a=c condition, the matched data in the two tables is distributed to the same shard. This way, a local join operation is performed on the tables to accelerate data queries.
            begin;
            create table tbl1(
            a int not null,
            b text not null
            );
            call set_table_property('tbl1', 'distribution_key', 'a');
            
            create table tbl2(
            c int not null,
            d text not null
            );
            call set_table_property('tbl2', 'distribution_key', 'c');
            commit;
                                                
            ```
            
        
    - Execute the following statement to join the tables:
        
        ```sql
        select * from tbl1  join tbl2 on tbl1.a=tbl2.c;
        ```
        
    
    The following figure shows the data distribution.![‰∏§Ë°®ÂÖ≥ËÅîjoin](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0573448761/p529887.png)You can query the execution plan by executing the Explain statement.

- Specify only one of the join columns as a distribution key.
    
    If one of the join columns of the two tables is not specified as a distribution key, Hologres shuffles data among different shards during queries. Hologres determines whether to shuffle or broadcast the data based on the size of the two tables that you want to join. In this example, Column¬†`a`¬†of the table named¬†`tbl1`¬†is specified as a distribution key, and Column¬†`d`¬†of the table named¬†`tbl2`¬†is specified as another distribution key. If you join the tbl1 table and the tbl2 table by using the¬†`a=c`¬†condition, Hologres shuffles the data in Column¬†`c`¬†in each shard. This reduces query efficiency.
    
    - Execute the following DDL statements to create two tables:

### Specify distribution keys for multiple tables that you want to join

Take note of the following rules when you join multiple tables:

- If the join columns of the tables are the same, you can specify these columns as distribution keys.
    
- If the join columns of the tables are different, you can specify the join columns of the large tables as distribution keys.
    

In the following examples, three tables are joined. If you want to join more than three tables, use one of the following examples as a reference:

- The join columns of the three tables are the same.
    
    If the join columns of the three tables are the same, you can specify these columns as distribution keys to implement a local join. This scenario is the simplest scenario.
    
    - Syntax supported in Hologres V2.1 and later:
        
        ```sql
        BEGIN;
        CREATE TABLE join_tbl1 (
            a int NOT NULL,
            b text NOT NULL
        )
        WITH (
            distribution_key = 'a'
        );
        CREATE TABLE join_tbl2 (
            a int NOT NULL,
            d text NOT NULL,
            e text NOT NULL
        )
        WITH (
            distribution_key = 'a'
        );
        CREATE TABLE join_tbl3 (
            a int NOT NULL,
            e text NOT NULL,
            f text NOT NULL,
            g text NOT NULL
        )
        WITH (
            distribution_key = 'a'
        );
        COMMIT;
        
        -- Execute the following statement to join the three tables:
        SELECT * FROM join_tbl1
        INNER JOIN join_tbl2 ON join_tbl2.a = join_tbl1.a
        INNER JOIN join_tbl3 ON join_tbl2.a = join_tbl3.a;
        ```
        
    - Syntax supported in all Hologres versions:
        
        ```sql
        begin;
        create table join_tbl1(
        a int not null,
        b text not null
        );
        call set_table_property('join_tbl1', 'distribution_key', 'a');
        
        create table join_tbl2(
        a int not null,
        d text not null,
        e text not null
        );
        call set_table_property('join_tbl2', 'distribution_key', 'a');
        
        create table join_tbl3(
        a int not null,
        e text not null,
        f text not null,
        g text not null
        );
        call set_table_property('join_tbl3', 'distribution_key', 'a');
        commit;
        
        -- Execute the following statement to join the three tables:
        SELECT * FROM join_tbl1
        INNER JOIN join_tbl2 ON join_tbl2.a = join_tbl1.a
        INNER JOIN join_tbl3 ON join_tbl2.a = join_tbl3.a;
        ```
        
    
    You can query the execution plan by executing the Explain statement.
    
    - The¬†`redistribution`¬†operator is not included in the execution plan. This indicates that no data is redistributed and that a local join operation is performed.
        
    - The¬†`exchange`¬†operator indicates a shift from file-level aggregation to shard-level aggregation. In this case, only data in the corresponding shard is aggregated. This improves data query efficiency.
        
    
    ![3Ë°®join](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6888515761/p529912.png)
    
- The join columns of the three tables are different.
    
    In actual business scenarios, if you want to join multiple tables, the join columns may be different. In this case, take note of the following rules when you specify a distribution key:
    
    - Compared with small tables, large tables have a higher priority because small tables contain only a small amount of data. You can preferentially specify the join columns of the large tables as distribution keys.
        
    - If the amount of data in the tables is nearly the same, specify columns on which the GROUP BY operation is frequently performed as distribution keys.
        
    
    In the following example, three tables named join_tbl_1, join_tbl_2, and join_tbl_3 are to be joined, and the join columns are not exactly the same. In this case, specify the join columns of the large tables as distribution keys. The¬†`join_tbl_1`¬†table contains 10 million data entries. Both the¬†`join_tbl_2`¬†table and the¬†`join_tbl_3`¬†table contain one million data entries. Use the¬†`join_tbl_1`¬†table as the main optimization object.

    - The¬†`redistribution`¬†operator is used for the computing of the¬†`join_tbl_2`¬†table and the¬†`join_tbl_3`¬†table. The¬†`join_tbl_3`¬†table is a small table, and the join column of the small table is different from the distribution key. Therefore, the data is redistributed.
        
    - No¬†`redistribution`¬†operator is used for the computing of the¬†`join_tbl_1`¬†table and the¬†`join_tbl_2`¬†table. The join columns of the two tables are specified as the distribution keys. Therefore, the data is not redistributed.

## Examples

- Syntax supported in Hologres V2.1 and later:
    
    ```sql
    -- Specify a single column as a distribution key.
    CREATE TABLE tbl (
        a int NOT NULL,
        b text NOT NULL
    )
    WITH (
        distribution_key = 'a'
    );
    
    -- Specify multiple columns to constitute a distribution key.
    CREATE TABLE tbl (
        a int NOT NULL,
        b text NOT NULL
    )
    WITH (
        distribution_key = 'a,b'
    );
    
    
    -- In scenarios where multiple tables are joined, specify join columns as distribution keys.
    BEGIN;
    CREATE TABLE tbl1 (
        a int NOT NULL,
        b text NOT NULL
    )
    WITH (
        distribution_key = 'a'
    );
    CREATE TABLE tbl2 (
        c int NOT NULL,
        d text NOT NULL
    )
    WITH (
        distribution_key = 'c'
    );
    COMMIT;
    
    SELECT b, count(*) FROM tbl1 JOIN tbl2 ON tbl1.a = tbl2.c GROUP BY b;
    ```
    
- Syntax supported in all Hologres versions:
    
    ```sql
    -- Specify a single column as a distribution key.
    begin;
    create table tbl (a int not null, b text not null);
    call set_table_property('tbl', 'distribution_key', 'a');
    commit;
    
    -- Specify multiple columns to constitute a distribution key.
    begin;
    create table tbl (a int not null, b text not null);
    call set_table_property('tbl', 'distribution_key', 'a,b');
    commit;
    
    -- In scenarios where multiple tables are joined, specify join columns as distribution keys.
    begin;
    create table tbl1(a int not null, b text not null);
    call set_table_property('tbl1', 'distribution_key', 'a');
    create table tbl2(c int not null, d text not null);
    call set_table_property('tbl2', 'distribution_key', 'c');
    commit;
    
    select b, count(*) from tbl1 join tbl2 on tbl1.a = tbl2.c group by b;
    ```
