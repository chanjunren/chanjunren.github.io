## Mapping types

| Type                    | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recursive (map)         | If the result of this mapping exists as another mapping, Vim will execute that as well  |
| Non Recursive (noremap) | Vim will execute the result of this mapping as-is, without considering further mappings |
