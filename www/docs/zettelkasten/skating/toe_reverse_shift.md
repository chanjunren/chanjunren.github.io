- 由于外摆的支撑腿在前进侧,所以身体重心会靠支撑腿一侧多一些。前转后的时候辅腿往前进方向蹬出,带动腰发力, 脚踝压住内韧或适当踩正,可在腰胯发力不足的时候轻微转动调整脚尖方向。
- 后转前的时候辅腿小腿尽量收住,往前进方向顶出膝盖带动腰胯发力,脚踝同理前转后做随机应变。转向过程中,转向点保持在桩线中间,手臂始终与脚下做反方向发力。
- 初学者也可以在每一下转向中间(桩线中间)做一个小停顿,目的是为了调整身体以便于更高的做每一次转向的发力。

```ad-info
- Supporting leg that is extended outward is on the advancing side, the body's center of gravity will lean more toward the supporting leg
- When turning from front to back, the auxiliary leg kicks out in the direction of advancement, driving the waist to exert force
- The ankle presses down on the inner edge or steps straight appropriately. When the waist and hips are not exerting enough force, you can slightly rotate to adjust the direction of the toes.
- When turning from back to front, the auxiliary leg's calf should be kept as close as possible, pushing out the knee in the direction of advancement to drive the waist and hips to exert force
- The ankle does the same as in the front-to-back turn, adapting to the situation
- During the turning process, keep the turning point in the middle of the cone line, and the arms always exert force in the opposite direction to the feet
- Beginners can also make a small pause in the middle of each turn (in the middle of the cone line) to adjust the body for better exertion of force in each turn.
