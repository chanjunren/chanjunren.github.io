### 起法

正摆(外韧内摆)的起法不固定,通常会选择后转前的方向起。
起脚后直接做转向的发力,控制好单轮每次
的转向在两桩之间,桩线内即可。

```ad-info
- The starting method for a straight swing (outer edge with inner swing) is not fixed, and usually, the direction from back to front is chosen
- After starting, directly exert force for turning, controlling each turn of the single wheel to be between two cones, within the line of cones.
```

### 发力

发力时辅腿带胯转支撑腿,手臂自然抬平并做反方
向逆旋转发力(与脚下发力方向相反)。从而产生
弧线+定点转向"的路线,重心往前进方向靠近
始终保持单轮位于重心正下方,微踩外韧,

```ad-info
- When exerting force, the auxiliary leg leads the hips to turn the supporting leg

- Arms are naturally raised and leveled, and exert force in the opposite direction for counter-rotation (opposite to the direction of force exertion under the feet)

- This creates a route of "arc + fixed-point turning," with the center of gravity leaning toward the forward direction, always keeping the single wheel directly under the center of gravity, and lightly pressing on the outer edge.
```

### 要点

完成一次转向后,需稳住身体形态直到支撑腿单轮滑行到下两个桩之间,再做前转
后的发力。
但部分老手可以选择完成一次转向后,紧接着主动去做下一次发力,使
得动作产生加速。

```ad-info
- After completing one turn, you need to stabilize the body posture until the supporting leg's single wheel slides between the next two cones, then exert force for the next turn from front to back

- However, some experienced skaters may choose to actively exert force for the next turn immediately after completing one turn, causing the movement to accelerate.
