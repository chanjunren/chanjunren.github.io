### wall calf stretch (gastrocnemius focus)
- stand facing a wall, place hands on it.
- step one foot back, keep **back leg straight**, heel pressed down.
- lean forward until you feel a stretch in the upper calf.
- **hold 30 sec/side, 2 reps**.

### bent-knee calf stretch (soleus focus)
- same as above, but **bend your back knee**.
- targets the deeper soleus muscle (critical for toe-wheel control).
- **hold 30 sec/side, 2 reps**.

### downward dog (瑜伽姿势)
- hands and feet on ground, hips raised, heels pressing toward the floor.
- alternate bending knees to isolate each calf.
## strengthen weak dorsiflexors (胫骨前肌)
### resistance band toe pulls
- sit with legs straight, loop a band around your toes.
- pull toes toward you against resistance.
- **3 sets of 15 reps/side**.
### towel scrunches
- place a towel on the floor, use toes to scrunch it toward you.
- **2 sets of 10 reps/side**.
### ankle alphabet
- lift one foot and “write” the alphabet with your toes.
- works full ankle range of motion.
## recovery & consistency
- **foam roll calves daily**: even without a ball, use a water bottle or rolling pin.
- **ankle circles before bed**: 10 reps clockwise/counter-clockwise per foot.
- **track progress**: record max toe-wheel hold time weekly.
