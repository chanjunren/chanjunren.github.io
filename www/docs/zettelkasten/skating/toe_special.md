- 首先这个动作的发力节奏和身形和外韧正摆是相同的。所以同理脚向左的时候,手臂向右。
- 发力向前过板的时候支撑脚在90的时候, 向反方向做一个小的蹬地的发力, 过到下一个桩中间的时候调整身形再拉向后。向后发力时辅腿小腿尽可能收住不要甩出去。
- 注意脚踝压韧的问题, 初学者在刚开始练的时候可以尝试在桩中间带上停顿,完整的把向前和向后的转髋摆手的发力做出来。同时注意脚踝"负角度"过桩的形态也要保持住

- First, the rhythm of exertion and body posture in this movement are the same as those in the outward swing with the correct edge
<br/>
- Therefore, when the foot is pointed to the left, the arms should be pointed to the right.
<br/>
- When exerting force to move forward over the board, at the 90-degree point of the supporting foot, make a small pushing force in the opposite direction, and when reaching the middle of the next cone, adjust the body posture and pull backward. When exerting force backward, the auxiliary leg's calf should be kept as close as possible and not swung out
<br/>
- Pay attention to the issue of pressing the edge with the ankle
<br/>
- Beginners can try to pause in the middle of the cones when starting to practice, and fully execute the force exertion of turning the hips and swinging the arms forward and backward
<br/>
- At the same time, pay attention to maintaining the posture of passing the cones with a "negative angle" at the ankle.
