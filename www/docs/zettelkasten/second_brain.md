1.   Do beginners tutorials. I cannot stress this enough. Not only will this save you a great deal of time and frustration, but probably from rage quitting as well. Even if they don't teach you the specific thing you want, after doing the beginners tutorials you will at least have a feel for the program, understand the basic navigation controls and have the vocabulary to ask the right questions. Make notes as you go, particularly of hot keys. This is the the monkey-see-monkey-do phase.

2.    Repeat the tutorial from memory. Makes notes on the bits that didn't stick the first time that you have to look up. This is the challenge, how much can you remember?

3.    Now make something similar, but not the same. Similar in that you don't need tools you haven't learned yet, but not the same so you have to start making your own choices. Instead of a donut, make a cupcake or something. This is what forces you to not just get stuck with the tutorials.

4.    Move on to the next tutorial. Give each one your best shot, and move on. These are learning exercise, sketches, not finished masterpieces, don't get stuck obsessing over it at this stage as repetition of the basics is key and you won't get to do that by spending hours obsessing over one settings. Save that for later.

5.    Doodle. Spend a part of your allocated daily time with blender just messing about with what you know so far. Don't think about "making a project" that brings all kinds of expectations with it you don't need. Just doodle in 3D.

6.    Ask questions. No one minds helping those who are making an effort. Tell us what you are doing, what you expected to happen, what did happen, what you did to try and fix it. Post a screenshot and include the whole Blender window - a picture speaks a thousand words. (If you are tempted to whip out your mobile phone right now, STOP, go and look up how to do screen shots eh?)

7.    Don't get discouraged. Your ability to see what looks goods will advance more quickly than your ability to actually do it. This should be expected. Also don't compare yourself to others, the only measure of progress that counts is, do you know something today that you didn't yesterday? Can you do something better today than you did yesterday? The rest is bullshit.

Remember that these initial tutorials are about learning Blender and its tools and workflows, don't get put off because you don't want to make donuts, the subject matter is circumstantial.

Once you're comfortable with the interface and the basic tools then use your end goal to direct what tutorials you do after. Most tutorials are not aimed at beginners and you will likely not have a clue what's going on without some familiarity with the UI. I would personally recommend doing at least BlenderGurus Donut, Chair and Anvil tutorials before diving into more specific material. Other people will suggest other good sources but these are the ones I've done so can recommend.

Grant Abitt is also really good and has a new Blender 3.0 Beginners Guide. It won't hurt you to do both.

This is also worth a listen - Blender Guru "How would I train you for a 3D art competition if there was only 4 weeks to do it?" [https://youtu.be/Nj_l6YHMj-c](https://youtu.be/Nj_l6YHMj-c)
