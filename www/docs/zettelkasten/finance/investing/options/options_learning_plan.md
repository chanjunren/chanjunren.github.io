# options_learning_plan

**Core Concept**: Structured path to learn options trading, from basic mechanics to risk management and strategies.

## Why It Matters

Options are leveraged instruments that can amplify gains or wipe out capital. Learning systematically prevents costly mistakes.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations
**Goal**: Understand what options are and basic mechanics

1. [[options_basics]] - Calls, puts, premiums
2. [[options_greeks]] - Delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho
3. [[intrinsic_extrinsic_value]] - How options are priced
4. [[options_expiration]] - Settlement and exercise

**Practice**: Paper trading on Think or Swim / IBKR simulator

### Phase 2: Basic Strategies
**Goal**: Execute simple directional trades safely

5. [[long_call]] - Bullish leverage
6. [[long_put]] - Bearish protection
7. [[covered_call]] - Income generation
8. [[cash_secured_put]] - Acquire stocks at discount

**Practice**: Single-leg trades with risk-defined positions

### Phase 3: Spreads
**Goal**: Reduce cost and define risk

9. [[vertical_spreads]] - Bull/bear call and put spreads
10. [[iron_condor]] - Range-bound income
11. [[calendar_spreads]] - Time decay advantage
12. [[diagonal_spreads]] - Combining time and strikes

**Practice**: Multi-leg spreads with capped risk

### Phase 4: Advanced Concepts
**Goal**: Understand volatility and position sizing

- [[implied_volatility]] - IV rank and percentile (already created)
- [[options_risk_management]] - Stop losses, position limits (already created)

**Practice**: Volatility-aware entry and exit strategies

## Key Mental Shifts

| Stock Trading | Options Trading | Note |
|---------------|-----------------|------|
| Buy and hold | Time decay matters | Theta burns |
| Direction only | Direction + timing + volatility | 3 dimensions |
| Stock price = value | Premium = intrinsic + extrinsic | Time value decays |
| Unlimited time | Expiration deadline | Forced decision |
| Linear P&L | Non-linear payoffs | Greeks matter |

## Study Tips

- **Start with LEAPs** (1+ year) - Less time pressure
- **Paper trade 3 months** - Learn without losing money
- **Trade liquid underlyings** - SPY, QQQ, AAPL (tight spreads)
- **Define risk first** - Never enter without exit plan
- **Track every trade** - Journal wins and losses

## Trade-offs

**Options strengths**: Leverage, flexibility, defined risk, income generation  
**Options risks**: Time decay, complexity, liquidity issues, total loss potential

## Platform Recommendations

**Singapore context**:
- Interactive Brokers (IBKR) - Best for US options
- Tiger Brokers - Local platform, US options access
- Moomoo - Paper trading features

**Features needed**: Options approval, real-time Greeks, strategy analyzer

This learning plan builds on [[stock_quick_start]] and [[technical_analysis]] as foundational knowledge.
