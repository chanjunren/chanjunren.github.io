# value_investing

**Core Concept**: Buy stocks below intrinsic value, hold until market recognizes true worth.

## How to Find Value

**Metrics**: P/E < industry avg, P/B < 1.0, high dividend yield, strong free cash flow, low debt

**Qualitative**: Competitive moat, good management, understandable business

## Process

1. Screen by valuation (P/E < 15, P/B < 1.5)
2. Read annual reports, analyze business
3. Calculate intrinsic value
4. Buy at 20-30%+ discount (margin of safety)
5. Hold years, track business not price
6. Exit when price = fair value or fundamentals break

## Trade-offs

**Pros**: Evidence-based (Buffett, Graham), margin of safety, tax efficient

**Cons**: Time intensive, requires patience (years), value traps exist, concentration risk

**Value traps**: ⚠️ Cyclicals at peak, declining industries, high debt + weak cash flow

## Singapore

Banks (DBS, OCBC, UOB): stable, high dividends. REITs: below NAV, 5-7% yields

Resources: SGX annual reports, InvestingNote

## Best For

Long-term investors (5+ years) who enjoy financial analysis and want to beat market via skill
