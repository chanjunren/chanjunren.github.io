# skating_wheeling
 ## general
- 零速起 (start from stationary wheeling)
> rely on kicking leg to understand how to generate force
- 提膝，扭胯，蹬地
- hands should 交叉 with legs
- in general, should start from flat and understand how the other leg / body is used to generate momentum
- do not put all your weight on the ankle, weight should move along the line of cones
```ad-warning
❗️ coach say my problem is that my knee keeps bending and i keep putting weight on my ankle, need to tip my toe higher [[skating_improving_toe_height]]
```

## flat wheeling
### special
- kick and move leg in a crescent arc 
## reverse flat shift
- leg should move in an arc
- need to  蹬地
- use your 跨 
- hands should 

## toe wheeling

### general
- heel up all the way 
- don’t bend knee
- engage core 

## back wheeling
- rhythm 
- toe higher

## forward to back
- start from 0
- do transition from shift

### toe shift training
- start from stationary wheeling
- pull leg back
- lift knee up to the side
- leg should be hooked
- (my) mistakes 
	- weight on my ankle 
	- should be on my toes
	- need to lift toe higher
	- press on the back of the skate

1. 起脚后直接做转向的发力，控制好单轮每次的转向在两桩之间，桩线内即可
The starting method for forward swing (outside-in) is not fixed. Usually, you begin from a backward-to-forward rotation.
After lifting the foot, directly apply rotational force, making sure each single-wheel turn stays between the two cones, within the cone line.

2. 发力时辅腿带跨转支撑腿，手臂自然抬平并做反方向逆旋转发力（与脚下发力方向相反）
从而产生“弧线+定点转向”的路线
重心往前进方向靠近，始终保持单轮位于重心正下方，微踩外勒
When applying force, the free leg and hip drive the support leg, while the arms lift naturally and rotate in the opposite direction to generate counter-rotation (opposite to the foot’s direction of force)

This creates a “curve + fixed-point turning” path

3. 完成一次转向后，需稳住身体形态直到支撑腿单轮滑行到下两个桩之间，再做前转后的发力
但部分老手可以选择完成一次转向后，紧接着主动去做下一次发力，使得动作产生加速。
After completing one turn, you need to stabilize your body posture until the supporting leg glides between the next two cones, then apply force for the next forward-to-back rotation.
However, some advanced skaters may choose to immediately continue with the next push right after finishing one rotation, which accelerates the movement.

Keep the center of gravity leaning toward the forward direction, and always keep the single wheel directly under the center of gravity, with slight pressure on the outside edge.

### fan bai
- kick in the direction of the cone
### crazy leg
- 前外后内 (刃)
### forward 8
- start with swinging leg behind
- turn left hand in front first then bring swinging leg up
- 定 position to stop by twisting hip (right hand in front swinging leg behind)
- swinging leg bring to the left, left hand up
- 定 position to stop by twisting hip (right hand in front swinging leg behind)

### backwards 8
- second half ti shou
- don’t focus on toe, think about entire cog / body
- start with swinging leg behind
- turn left hand in front first then kick swinging knee up and hold it in front.
- ding position by putting right hand in front
- step behind, to the left and bring right hand to the back
- ding position by bringing swinging knee up and right hand in front
