## Statically Typed Languages
>   Require variables to be explicitly defined with a type at compile time
   
- Examples:
	- Java
	- C++
	- Rust
- Benefits 
	- Early error detection 
	- Performance optimizations


## Dynamically Typed Languages

> Determine variable types at runtime

- Examples 
	- Python
	- JavaScript
	- Ruby
- Benefits 
	- More flexibility
	- Faster prototyping 
	- Less boilerplate code

## Strongly Typed Languages
>  Languages that enforce strict type rules and do not allow implicit type conversions

- Examples:
	- Python (to some extent) 
	- Haskell
- Benefits
	- Reduces runtime errors 
	- Can require more explicit code

## Weakly Typed Languages
> Allow implicit type conversions and are more lenient with type rules

- Examples:
	- JavaScript 
	- PHP
-  Unexpected behavior 
- Allows for more flexible coding
