```ad-summary
Procedural programming focuses on writing procedures or functions that perform operations on data

Programs are structured as a sequence of instructions.
```

## Key Principles
    
### Modularity
> Breaking down programs into smaller, reusable functions or procedures.
        
### Step-by-Step Execution
> Programs follow a linear flow, executing instructions in a predefined order.
        
### Top-Down Design
> Programs are designed by breaking down problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
        
## Use Cases
- Simple, linear tasks or scripts (e.g., data processing, automation).
- Systems where performance and control over hardware are critical (e.g., embedded systems).
- **Examples:** C, Pascal, Fortran.
