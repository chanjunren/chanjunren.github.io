# skating_choreo

```ad-abstract
i asked chatgpt how to think about music
```
## 🧠 tl;dr high-level approach
1. **focus on the beat**: learn to find and count the _main pulse_ of the song.
2. **structure moves around counts**: plan your moves in counts of 4 or 8.
3. **use repetition and contrast**: match repeated musical patterns with repeated moves, and switch it up when the music changes.
4. **start simple**: groove with your body weight first before trying complex tricks.
5. **practice with familiar songs**: especially ones with clear and steady beats.

## 🎵 what to listen for in the music

|element|what it means|how you react|
|---|---|---|
|**beat**|the regular pulse of the song (like a heartbeat). usually 60–120 bpm.|time your pushes, steps, or direction changes to the beat.|
|**downbeat (1)**|usually the strongest beat in a 4-count phrase.|great for _big movements_ like jumps, turns, or a trick climax.|
|**rhythm / groove**|the "feel" or repeated pattern — e.g., boom-**cha**-ka-**boom**.|echo this with repeated tricks, toe/heel work, or subtle body movements.|
|**changes in energy**|a drop, chorus, or build-up.|do a spin during a drop, or pick up speed in a chorus. highlight the change with your move.|

## 🧩 how to break down a song for skating

### count in 4s or 8s
most pop, hip-hop, and electronic music follows a 4/4 time signature, so count like this:

`one – two – three – four – one – two – three – four`

try doing **one move per count**, or a full sequence that takes 4 or 8 counts.
👉 **tip**: nod your head or clap while listening to songs when you're off skates. start to feel that steady pulse.

### mark key moments
as you listen:
- where does the **beat drop**?
- where’s the **chorus**?
- is there a **build-up** before something intense?

### match mood and move

| music feels like... | try moves like...                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| chill / lo-fi       | smooth transitions, manuals, toe/heel work    |
| punchy / funky      | quick tricks, foot switches, syncopated steps |
| epic / orchestral   | large flowing moves, turns, pose-y movements  |
| edm / house         | fast-paced sequences, beat-matching spins     |

## 🧑‍🏫 training your musical ear (even without “talent”)

### ✅ tools you can use
- use a **metronome app** (or youtube “bpm counter”) to feel beats.
- play a song and try clapping or stomping to the beat.
- watch skating videos and try to count their moves — can you spot the beat they follow?
- try apps like:
    - **ableton link (for looping parts of songs)**
    - **soundbrenner** (a musician’s metronome app)

## 🛼 skate practice ideas

### 🔁 simple drill (beat sync)
1. pick a song with a clear beat (e.g. bruno mars, daft punk).
2. try skating 4 cones per 4 beats.
3. add a spin or pose on the 1st beat of a new phrase.
### 🎭 emotive drill (music-matching)
skate to a song and try _expressing the energy_ rather than counting:
- flow like water in slow parts.
- be explosive on energetic beats.

## 🧩 final thoughts
rhythm in skating is like the invisible frame holding your moves together. you're not just doing cool tricks — you're telling a story _with music as the narrator_. 🎶
start with one song you like, break it down into sections, count the beats, and choreograph just a few moves for each part. then expand!
if you want, i can help you analyze a specific song and suggest types of movements that would match the mood and rhythm — just drop me a track 🎧🛼
keep skating, and let the music move you.
