**Why `READ COMMITTED` Can Lead to Inconsistency**

The core reason `READ COMMITTED` can lead to inconsistency is that it allows transactions to read data that has been committed by other transactions, even if those other transactions are still in progress. This means that the data a transaction reads might change during the course of its execution, leading to potential inconsistencies.

**Types of Inconsistencies**

1. **Non-Repeatable Reads:**

- **Scenario:** A transaction reads a row, then another transaction updates that same row and commits. If the first transaction reads the same row again, it will see the updated value, even though it hasn't made any changes itself.
- **Impact:** This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on data remaining consistent within a transaction. For example, if you're calculating a total based on multiple rows, the total could change if some of the rows are updated by other transactions while your transaction is still running.

2. **Phantom Reads:**

- **Scenario:** A transaction executes a query that returns a set of rows based on certain criteria. Then, another transaction inserts a new row that also satisfies those criteria and commits. If the first transaction re-executes the same query, it will now see the new row, even though it wasn't there initially.
- **Impact:** This can be problematic for applications that need to maintain a consistent view of the data over time. For example, if you're generating a report based on a set of rows, the report could include additional rows if new data is inserted while the report is being generated.

**Key Point:**

- `READ COMMITTED` prevents _dirty reads_ (reading uncommitted data from other transactions), but it doesn't protect against _non-repeatable reads_ or _phantom reads_.

**Trade-offs**

- **Consistency vs. Concurrency:** `READ COMMITTED` offers a balance between consistency and concurrency. It allows for more concurrency than higher isolation levels like `REPEATABLE READ` or `SERIALIZABLE`, but at the cost of potential inconsistencies.
- **Application Requirements:** The acceptability of these inconsistencies depends entirely on your application's specific requirements. Some applications might be perfectly fine with occasional inconsistencies, while others might require strict data consistency guarantees.

**In the Context of Deadlocks**

- `READ COMMITTED` can help reduce the likelihood of deadlocks because transactions don't need to acquire exclusive locks for reading data. This can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where you have many concurrent read operations and occasional updates.
- However, if your application relies on strong data consistency within a transaction, lowering the isolation level to `READ COMMITTED` might not be a suitable solution.

**Recommendation:**

- Carefully analyze your application's requirements and the potential impact of inconsistencies before considering lowering the isolation level.
- If possible, try to optimize your queries and application logic to minimize lock contention without sacrificing data consistency.
- If you decide to use `READ COMMITTED`, thoroughly test your application to ensure it can handle the potential inconsistencies gracefully.

Remember, choosing the right isolation level involves balancing the need for consistency with the desire for concurrency.
