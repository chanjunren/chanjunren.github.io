# object_oriented_programming

```ad-summary
OOP organizes software design around "objects," which are instances of classes that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods)
```
## Key Principles
    
### Encapsulation
> Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class)

Access to data is controlled through methods, ensuring data integrity.
### Inheritance
> Creating new classes (child classes) from existing ones (parent classes) to reuse and extend functionality

Promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization.

### Polymorphism
> Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass

Enables flexibility and dynamic behavior (e.g., method overriding).
        
### Abstraction
> Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem domain, hiding unnecessary details
        
## Use Cases
- Large-scale applications with complex relationships (e.g., enterprise software, game development).
- Systems requiring modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
- **Examples:** Java, C++, Python, Ruby.
