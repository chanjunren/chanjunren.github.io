### Overview

To achieve better mobility and flexibility in your hips and ankles, particularly for skating moves like inner volte, eagle, Z eagle, and high kicks, the approach is based on a combination of **stretching**, **resistance training**, and **progressive overload**.

### Key Points

1. **Ankle Mobility and Flexibility**
    
    - **Progressive Overload in Dorsiflexion**:
        - Work on "hyper" dorsiflexion, which is an exaggerated flexing of the ankle (toes pulled toward the shin).
        - Use body weight (BW) exercises or add weights progressively to increase strength and mobility in this position.
2. **Hip Mobility and Flexibility**
    
    - **Stretching to Desired End Position**:
        
        - Start by stretching to your desired end position (like a side split for skating moves).
        - Focus on getting comfortable in positions that mimic the skating moves you want to perform.
    - **Resistance Training in the Stretched Position**:
        
        - Begin with resistance bands and gradually introduce weights.
        - Perform resistance training exercises that mimic the desired range of motion (ROM) for the moves you're aiming to perfect.
        - For example, use the adductor/abductor machine at the gym:
            - Increase the stretch angle by one notch each week to gradually improve flexibility.
    - **Progressive Strength Building**:
        
        - Over time, aim to build strength in these positions by increasing resistance.
        - You can also use tools like a wooden balance board (from Taobao) to practice specific moves like rolling, weaving, and general speed maneuvers.
        - This helps to reinforce flexibility with functional strength specific to skating.
3. **Dynamic Flexibility Exercises**
    
    - **Stretch with Assistance**:
        - Start by using your hands or other forms of assistance to get into the stretched position (e.g., using hands to help push legs apart in a butterfly stretch).
    - **Active Hold Without Assistance**:
        - Gradually work on holding these positions without any assistance. This means using only your leg muscles to maintain a stretch or position (e.g., a butterfly stretch without hands).
4. **Progressive Load and Mobility Exercises**
    
    - **Stretch to Get Position**: Begin with basic stretching to improve your flexibility towards the desired position.
    - **Use Assistance to Get into Position**: Use tools like resistance bands or your hands to help you get deeper into a stretch.
    - **Resistance Training in Position**: Perform resistance exercises that strengthen muscles in that specific range of motion.

### Suggested Routine for Better Flexibility and Mobility

1. **Ankle Routine**:
    
    - Dorsiflexion exercises (bodyweight or weighted).
    - Increase range over time by adding weight or reps.
2. **Hip Routine**:
    
    - Side splits stretch.
    - Adductor/abductor machine exercises.
    - Resistance band exercises for adductors and abductors.
3. **Dynamic and Functional Skating Exercises**:
    
    - Practice skating moves with varying levels of assistance (e.g., using a balance board for rolling or weaving).
    - Gradually reduce assistance as you become more flexible and stronger.

### Key Takeaways

- Start with stretching to improve initial flexibility.
- Introduce resistance gradually to strengthen muscles in those extended positions.
- Combine static stretching with dynamic exercises to ensure mobility gains are functional and applicable to your skating goals.
- Use progressive overload techniques (increasing angle or resistance) to continuously challenge your muscles and improve flexibility.

By structuring your workouts in this manner, you can systematically work towards achieving the desired flexibility and mobility for skating moves.
