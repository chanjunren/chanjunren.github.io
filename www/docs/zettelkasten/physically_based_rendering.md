# physically_based_rendering

Those textures (especially the metalness and the roughness) follow what we call PBR principles. PBR stands for Physically Based Rendering. It regroups many techniques that tend to follow real-life directions to get realistic results.

While there are many other techniques, PBR is becoming the standard for realistic renders, and many software, engines, and libraries are using it.

For now, we will simply focus on how to load textures, how to use them, what transformations we can apply, and how to optimize them. We will see more about PBR in later lessons, but if you're curious, you can learn more about it here:
