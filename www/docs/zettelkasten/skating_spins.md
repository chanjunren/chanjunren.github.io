# skating_spins

## toe chicken 
- start with 撑 toe chicken (5 rounds)
- roll with left leg trailing and lifted to the back
- once you have rolled to beside the cone, flick your leg up, bring cog up

1. 起脚前上身提前向右旋转，辅腿后置。等支撑腿踩住重心压稳后，辅腿以画半圆的方式盘到支撑腿前侧。

Before lifting the front foot, rotate your upper body slightly to the right, and place the supporting leg behind. Once your support leg firmly holds the center of gravity, swing your free leg in a semicircle until it comes to the front side of the supporting leg.

2. 旋转中心轴立直，核心绷住，手臂自然抬平。辅腿不要太靠近支撑腿，利用髋关节外旋把小腿尽量横过去端着的感觉。支撑腿脚踝压住外刃，高度顶住。

Keep the central axis upright, engage your core, and lift your arms naturally to balance. The free leg should not be too close to the supporting leg. Use hip external rotation so that your calf crosses over with a “holding” sensation. For the supporting leg, press the ankle onto the outside edge and keep it firmly locked in height.

3. 初学者可以不采用盘腿的方式，把辅腿放置支撑腿一旁即可。

Beginners don’t need to use the full leg-crossing technique—just place the free leg next to the supporting leg, and that will be enough.

## back toe seven 
- raise left leg to the side 
- 内八
- shoulders twist to the side a bit
- 支撑
- 发力 > kick out towards 2 o clock

### detailed technique notes:
1. 注意起脚时整个身体往旋转方向发力才会有旋转速度。辅腿注意不仅仅是后拉还要增加一些外旋，与支撑脚的对侧手连同辅腿和腰一起做旋转发力。
   
When lifting your foot, the whole body must apply force in the direction of the spin in order to generate rotation speed. The free leg should not only pull back but also add some outward rotation, coordinating with the opposite arm of the supporting leg, so that the free leg and hip work together to drive the spin


2. 起脚后旋转轴处于干中心，手臂自然抬平（可向旋转方向带力），支撑脚外八字外刃绷住，辅腿的膝盖外旋并后拉。 

After taking off, keep your rotation axis centered. Raise your arms naturally (they can help bring power in the rotation direction). The supporting leg should hold firmly on the outside edge in a “figure-eight outward” position, while the free leg’s knee rotates outward and pulls back

3. 初期可采用双脚蛇后蛇及单轮后外韧圆弧练习作为前期辅助练习，主要为了增加旋转能力和单轮后外的支撑能力。

In the early stage, you can practice with backward snake steps using both feet, or draw arcs with the outside edge of the rear single wheel. These serve as preparatory drills to improve rotational ability and the supporting strength of the outside edge on one wheel

## 后外刃转
- left knee cannot exceed right knee
- right ankle need to flex right 
- when kicking, only use your thigh, calf shouldn’t move
- when going to the next cone, need to be outer edge
- take initiative to move my left leg, don’t wait
