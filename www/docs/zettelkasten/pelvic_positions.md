```ad-abstract
Pelvic positioning refers to the tilt or orientation of the pelvis, which affects posture, spinal alignment, and overall movement

## Anterior Pelvic Tilt

The front of the pelvis tilts downward, and the back of the pelvis rises

This increases the arch in the lower back (lumbar lordosis)
### Common Causes
- Tight hip flexors (e.g., iliopsoas, rectus femoris).
- Weak glutes and hamstrings.
- Prolonged sitting or poor posture.
### Effects
- Increased pressure on the lower back.
- Can lead to lower back pain and imbalances in the hip and spine.

## Posterior Pelvic Tilt

The back of the pelvis tilts downward, and the front rises

This reduces the lumbar curve (flattening the lower back).

### Common Causes
- Tight hamstrings and glutes.
- Weak hip flexors and lower back muscles.
- Poor sitting posture (e.g., slouching).
### Effects
- Reduced shock absorption in the spine.
- May cause discomfort or strain in the lower back and hips.

## Neutral Pelvis

The pelvis is in a balanced position, neither tilted forward nor backward

This aligns the spine naturally, maintaining a healthy lumbar curve.

### Why It‚Äôs Ideal
- Promotes even weight distribution through the spine and pelvis.
- Reduces risk of pain or injury.
- Improves efficiency in movement and posture.

## Lateral Pelvic Tilt

One side of the pelvis is higher than the other, often seen in asymmetries.
### Common Causes
- Muscle imbalances between the left and right sides.
- Leg length discrepancy.
- Weakness in the gluteus medius or core muscles.
### Effects
- Uneven weight distribution through the hips and spine.
- May lead to scoliosis or hip/knee discomfort.

## **Key Muscles Involved in Pelvic Tilt**
- **Anterior Tilt**: Tight hip flexors, weak glutes/hamstrings.
- **Posterior Tilt**: Tight hamstrings/glutes, weak hip flexors.
- **Lateral Tilt**: Weak gluteus medius, obliques, or core muscles.

Understanding your pelvic position and addressing imbalances with stretches and strengthening exercises can help improve posture, alleviate pain, and enhance movement efficiency.
