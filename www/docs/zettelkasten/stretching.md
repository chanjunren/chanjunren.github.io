# stretching
- Targets tight, shortened muscles, allowing joints to move through a greater range
- Increases tissue elasticity and reduces passive stiffness
- Prepares muscles for strengthening by reducing restrictions

## flexibility
- The ability of a muscle to lengthen and allow movement
- Refers to passive range of motion 


## Limitations
Passive stretching focuses on increasing muscle length and reducing stiffness > it doesn’t address the muscle's **active control** over the joint

- **Lack of Strength in New Range**
	- If you stretch and lengthen a muscle without strengthening it, your body may not feel "safe" using that new range of motion
	- This could lead to instability or an inability to access that range during movement.

- **Risk of Injury**
	- An overly flexible joint without supporting strength is more prone to dislocations or strains, as it lacks the control needed to stabilize itself

- **Short-Term Gains**
	- Stretching temporarily reduces tension 
	- BUT doesn’t necessarily lead to permanent changes unless paired with strengthening exercises that reinforce the new range.
