## Text3D helper

- Can create typeface fonts with http://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/
- Can use `drei`'s `<Center>` to help with centering

```tsx
import { Center, Text3D, OrbitControls } from "@react-three/drei";

export default function Experience() {
  return (
    <>
      <Perf position="top-left" />
      <OrbitControls makeDefault />
      <Center>
        <Text3D
          font="./fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json"
          size={0.75}
          height={0.2}
          curveSegments={12}
          bevelEnabled
          bevelThickness={0.02}
          bevelSize={0.02}
          bevelOffset={0}
          bevelSegments={5}
        >
          HELLO R3F
          <meshNormalMaterial />
        </Text3D>
      </Center>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Matcap Material

#### `useMatcapTexture`

- Automatically load matcaps from https://github.com/emmelleppi/matcaps
- Not recommended for production (since there is a dependency on this repository)
- Reference: https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps/blob/master/PAGE-17.md#7b5254_e9dcc7_b19986_c8ac91
- Try to use the **smallest possible size**
  - possible values: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024

```tsx
import {
  useMatcapTexture,
  Center,
  Text3D,
  OrbitControls,
} from "@react-three/drei";
export default function Experience() {
  // (matcap material, width)
  const matcapTexture = useMatcapTexture("7B5254_E9DCC7_B19986_C8AC91", 256);

  console.log(matcapTexture);

  // ...
}
```

```
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />

Donuts
18:22
As Homer Simpsons said, ‚ÄúDonuts. Is there anything they can't do?‚Äù

In life, we need donuts and in WebGL too.

First donut
We are going to create just one donut to start with.

Create a <mesh> with a <torusGeometry> in it and duplicate the <meshMatcapMaterial> that we used for the text:

export default function Experience()
{
// ...

    return <>

        {/* ... */}

        <mesh>
            <torusGeometry />
            <meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />
        </mesh>

    </>

}

Here‚Äôs a nice thick donut.

The default settings of <torusGeometry /> make it look good enough. Yet, if you want to tweak the geometry, you can do it using the args attribute.

Multiple donuts
That‚Äôs a cool donut, but how can we have a hundred of them?

We could duplicate it and try to position them randomly, but it would take ages and would probably not look very random. Instead, we need to do a loop and place them randomly.

Unfortunately, as we saw earlier, we can‚Äôt do a for loop in the JSX.

There are multiple alternatives and we already saw one that implies using the map method. But the map implies that we have an array. And because we need 100 donuts, we need an array 100 long. We don‚Äôt really care about what‚Äôs inside that array, as long as it‚Äôs 100 long.

Let‚Äôs experiment a little right before the return.

Create a tempArray:

export default function Experience()
{
// ...

    const tempArray = []
    console.log(tempArray)

    return // ...

}
This array currently has no element inside. We want it to be 100 long and we can do that with Array(100) instead of []:

const tempArray = Array(100)
console.log(tempArray)

You might notice that the array is being logged twice and it‚Äôs because our component is being re-rendered.

This is because some reactive data has changed in the component and, in this case, it‚Äôs caused by the <Text3D>. When the font finishes loading, the geometry is created and the scene has to be updated.

This is actually a normal behaviour. We could ask the component to wait for the <Text3D> before rendering by using a <Suspense> wrapping <Text3D>, but it‚Äôs actually not a big deal and it makes the rest of the scene (the donuts) visible while the font is loading which is why we are going to keep it like this.

We now have a 100 elements long array. Easy? Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt map on it.

If we try, we get nothing in the console:

const tempArray = Array(100)
tempArray.map(() =>
{
console.log('value')
})

It‚Äôs because, although its length is 100, it is still considered as empty.

To fix that, we can create a new array based on the values of that array.

To get the values of the array (not the array itself but only what‚Äôs inside), we can use the spread operator:

const tempArray = [...Array(100)]
tempArray.map(() =>
{
console.log('value')
})

(again, if you see twice the amount, it‚Äôs because the component is being re-rendered)

Weirdly, the result array we get is filled with a hundred instances of undefined and we can loop on it (welcome to JavaScript).

Note that they are other ways of creating an array, but we will see that later in the chapter.

Remove the tempArray.

Let‚Äôs transpose that in the JSX:

{ [...Array(100)].map(() =>
<mesh>
<torusGeometry />
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />
</mesh>
) }

The function we provide to map returns the <mesh> which results in 100 donuts one on top of each other.

Let‚Äôs add some randomness to the position:

{ [...Array(100)].map(() =>
<mesh
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] } >
<torusGeometry />
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />
</mesh>
) }

And to the scale:

{ [...Array(100)].map(() =>
<mesh
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] }
scale={ 0.2 + Math.random() \* 0.2 } >
<torusGeometry />
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />
</mesh>
) }

And to the rotation:

{ [...Array(100)].map(() =>
<mesh
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] }
scale={ 0.2 + Math.random() _ 0.2 }
rotation={ [
Math.random() _ Math.PI,
Math.random() \* Math.PI,
0
] } >
<torusGeometry />
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />
</mesh>
) }

We have our donuts, but if you check the console, you should see a warning triggered by React:

It‚Äôs because we are creating components in a loop, but we forgot to set a key to those components.

Here, we don‚Äôt have a unique ID. The warning isn‚Äôt even relevant since we are not going to manipulate the array, change the elements order, etc.

Let‚Äôs face it, we won‚Äôt be able to sleep knowing that we left a warning. We need to get rid of it.

Retrieve the index from the map by setting two arguments (value and index) and use the index on the key attribute:

{ [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
<mesh
key={ index }
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] }
scale={ 0.2 + Math.random() _ 0.2 }
rotation={ [
Math.random() _ Math.PI,
Math.random() \* Math.PI,
0
] } >
<torusGeometry />
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />
</mesh>
) }

Optimisation
29:50
Our little experiment seems complete, but we‚Äôve forgotten something important.

We made performance mistakes, which is crystal clear in the performance monitoring.

Geometries
We have many geometries although we should have only two (the donut and the text).

To fix that, we are going to do kind of a silly trick in 3 steps:

Create one <torusGeometry> outside of the donut. Meaning that it won‚Äôt be associated with anything.
Store it by using useState.
Put it back on the <mesh> of the donuts from the state.
It‚Äôs going to be a bit hard, but don‚Äôt worry, we will see an easier solution right after.

Import useState from react:

import { useState } from 'react'
Create a torusGeometry and setTorusGometry state with useState:

export default function Experience()
{
const [ torusGeometry, setTorusGeometry ] = useState()

    // ...

}
Move the <torusGeometry> outside of the <mesh> and the map (this will break the current torus):

<torusGeometry args={ [ 1, 0.6, 16, 32 ] } />

{ [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
<mesh
key={ index }
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] }
scale={ 0.2 + Math.random() _ 0.2 }
rotation={ [
Math.random() _ Math.PI,
Math.random() \* Math.PI,
0
] } >
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />
</mesh>
) }
Send the setTorusGometry function to the ref of the <torusGeometry>:

<torusGeometry ref={ setTorusGeometry } />
When sending a function to the ref attribute, React will call that function with the component as the parameter which would look a bit like setTorusGometry(<torusGeometry>) (although this code won‚Äôt work and is only used to explain).

In the end, the variable torusGeometry now contains the <torusGeometry> and we can send it to our <mesh> with the geometry attribute:

<mesh
key={ index }
geometry={ torusGeometry }
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] }
scale={ 0.2 + Math.random() _ 0.2 }
rotation={ [
Math.random() _ Math.PI,
Math.random() \* Math.PI,
0
] }

>

    <meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />

</mesh>

A bit tricky, but we now have only two geometries for the whole scene (the text and one torus).

Material
If you check the ‚Äúshaders‚Äù in the performance monitoring, you‚Äôll see that there is only one shader and that‚Äôs because Three.js automatically re-uses shaders when possible.

We could leave it like that, but let‚Äôs separate the material as we did for the geometry so that we‚Äôre only using one material for the text and the donuts.

We are going to do the same trick we did for the geometry by resorting to useState.

Move the <meshMatcapMaterial> out of the donuts <mesh> and remove it from the <Text3D> too:

<torusGeometry ref={ setTorusGeometry } />
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={ matcapTexture } />

<Center>
    <Text3D
        font="./fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json"
        size={ 0.75 }
        height={ 0.2 }
        curveSegments={ 12 }
        bevelEnabled
        bevelThickness={ 0.02 }
        bevelSize={ 0.02 }
        bevelOffset={ 0 }
        bevelSegments={ 5 }
    >
        HELLO R3F
    </Text3D>
</Center>

{ [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
<mesh
key={ index }
geometry={ torusGeometry }
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] }
scale={ 0.2 + Math.random() _ 0.2 }
rotation={ [
Math.random() _ Math.PI,
Math.random() \* Math.PI,
0
] }
/>
) }
Create a material and setMaterial state with useState:

export default function Experience()
{
const [ torusGeometry, setTorusGeometry ] = useState()
const [ material, setMaterial ] = useState()

    // ...

}
Send the setMaterial to the ref attribute of the <meshMatcapMaterial>

<meshMatcapMaterial ref={ setMaterial } matcap={ matcapTexture } />
Send the material state to the material attribute of the <Text3D> and donuts <mesh>:

<torusGeometry ref={ setTorusGeometry } />
<meshMatcapMaterial ref={ setMaterial } matcap={ matcapTexture } />

<Center>
    <Text3D
        material={ material }
        font="./fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json"
        size={ 0.75 }
        height={ 0.2 }
        curveSegments={ 12 }
        bevelEnabled
        bevelThickness={ 0.02 }
        bevelSize={ 0.02 }
        bevelOffset={ 0 }
        bevelSegments={ 5 }
    >
        HELLO R3F
    </Text3D>
</Center>

{ [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
<mesh
key={ index }
geometry={ torusGeometry }
material={ material }
position={ [
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10,
(Math.random() - 0.5) * 10
] }
scale={ 0.2 + Math.random() _ 0.2 }
rotation={ [
Math.random() _ Math.PI,
Math.random() \* Math.PI,
0
] }
/>
) }

No visual difference, but now everything is set and clean.

Simpler solution
Although it‚Äôs working, using useState like this is kind of a stretch and makes your code more complicated than it should be.

As we‚Äôve seen in previous lessons, nothing prevents us from creating variables outside of the component function.

We are going to create the geometry and the material before the Experience function using good old Three.js.

First, remove or comment the torusGeometry and material states (the code should break):

export default function Experience()
{
// const [ torusGeometry, setTorusGeometry ] = useState()
// const [ material, setMaterial ] = useState()

    // ...

}
And remove or comment the <torusGeometry> and <meshMatcapMaterial> (still broken):

{/_ <torusGeometry ref={ setTorusGeometry } /> _/}
{/_ <meshMatcapMaterial ref={ setMaterial } matcap={ matcapTexture } /> _/}
Since we are going to use native Three.js, let‚Äôs import THREE from three:

import \* as THREE from 'three'
And now, we can instantiate a TorusGeometry that we assign to a torusGeometry variable and a MeshMatcapMaterial that we assign to a material variable but outside of the Experience function:

const torusGeometry = new THREE.TorusGeometry(1, 0.6, 16, 32)
const material = new THREE.MeshMatcapMaterial()

export default function Experience()
{
// ...
}

The good news is that we can already see something. The bad news is that we lost the matcap texture.

Unfortunately, the matcapTexture is only available in the Experience function that will be triggered when the component is being rendered.

Since we want to apply the texture only once, we are going use useEffect.

Import useEffect from react:

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
Call useEffect in the Experience with an empty dependencies array so that it‚Äôs called only on the first component render:

export default function Experience()
{
// ...

    useEffect(() =>
    {
    }, [])

    // ...

}
In useEffect, we can assign the matcapTexture to the matcap property of the material. We also have to tell the material that it needs to be updated using the needsUpdate property:

useEffect(() =>
{
material.matcap = matcapTexture
material.needsUpdate = true
}, [])

We are almost there, but as you can see, the texture looks too bright. It‚Äôs because R3F automatically changed the colorSpace of the matcapTexture texture when we used it in the <meshMatcapMaterial> and we need to do it manually.

Set the colorSpace of matcapTexture to THREE.SRGBColorSpace and also set it‚Äôs needsUpdate property to true:

useEffect(() =>
{
matcapTexture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace
matcapTexture.needsUpdate = true

    material.matcap = matcapTexture
    material.needsUpdate = true

}, [])

And everything is working as it should.

As you can see, creating variables outside of the component can make things easier like with the torusGeometry, but also harder like with the material. It‚Äôs up to you, your project and your preferences.

Animating the donuts
46:02
We‚Äôve reached the point where we‚Äôve achieved what we had initially without using R3F.

As you can see, it was easier and the code is minimalist. And since it was too easy, let‚Äôs go a little further and animate the donuts.

Accessing the donuts
We are going to animate the donuts in the useFrame, but this means that we need a reference to them.

Referring to multiple objects is a bit tricky in React.

We are going to test a first ‚Äúsilly‚Äù technique, by animating the donuts to prove that it‚Äôs working and then test a more appropriate technique.

Using a group as reference
We are going to use a <group> as the parent of our donuts so that we can refer all donuts through its children property.

Create the <group> around the donuts:

<group>
    { [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
        {/* ... */}
    ) }
</group>
Import useRef from react:

import { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react'
Create a reference named donutsGroup:

export default function Experience()
{
const donutsGroup = useRef()

    // ...

}
Associate it with the group using the ref attribute:

<group ref={ donutsGroup }>
{ [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
{/_ ... _/}
) }
</group>
Updating the donuts
We now have access to the donuts as the children of the donutsGroup reference. Remember that every class, which inherits from Object3D (which is the case for the Group) has a children property.

In order to animate those children, we first need to import useFrame from @react-three/fiber:

import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
Call it in Experience and send it a function:

export default function Experience()
{
// ...

    useFrame(() =>
    {
    })

    // ...

}
Retrieve the state and delta parameters (we don‚Äôt need the state, but if we have to set it if we want access to delta):

useFrame((state, delta) =>
{
})
Loop through the children of the donutsGroup.current (don‚Äôt forget the current since it‚Äôs a reference) with a for ‚Ä¶ of and update their rotation.y property with the delta:

useFrame((state, delta) =>
{
for(const donut of donutsGroup.current.children)
{
donut.rotation.y += delta \* 0.2
}
})
And that‚Äôs it, the donuts are rotating.

Having an array as reference
The problem with the <group> is, that its sole purpose is to compensate for a structural flaw. We don‚Äôt need a Group, all we want is a way to loop on the donuts.

Let‚Äôs see how we can get rid of the <group> and still have access to the donuts in a reference.

First, we need to understand that the reference is only an object with a current property containing what we want to save and keep.

Knowing that, we are going to create a reference with its current being an empty array and, then, we‚Äôre going to add the donuts to that array ourselves.

First, let‚Äôs do some clean-up by removing the donutGroup reference, the <group> and the loop inside the useFrame.

Then, create a donuts reference using useRef and send it an empty array as a parameter:

export default function Experience()
{
const donuts = useRef([])

    // ...

}
Sending a value to useRef will set that value as the default current property of the reference.

Now, to the donut <mesh>, we are going to add a ref attribute but pass it a function.

{ [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
<mesh
ref={ () => {} }
// ...
/>
) }
React will call the function and send the actual component as a parameter.

We can then save it in the donuts.current property of donuts using push() because it‚Äôs a simple array:

<mesh
ref={ (element) => donuts.current.push(element) }
// ...
/>
But we‚Äôve made a mistake.

Every time the Experience component is rendered, donuts are added to the reference.

Even if it concerns the same donuts and R3F knows it should not create a new donut, our reference will keep filling up with the same donuts.

To fix that, we can add elements to the array at a specific position using the index of the map:

{ [...Array(100)].map((value, index) =>
<mesh
ref={ (element) => donuts.current[index] = element }
// ...
/>
) }
We now have our reference to the donuts without resorting to silly tricks.

We can go back to the useFrame and do the loop again to update the rotations, but this time on the donuts.current array.

useFrame((state, delta) =>
{
for(const donut of donuts.current)
{
donut.rotation.y += delta \* 0.2
}
})
Everything works the same way but without the cost of having a <group> on top of the donuts.
```
