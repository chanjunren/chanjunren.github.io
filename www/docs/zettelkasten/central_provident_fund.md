## Estate Planning - What Happens Upon Death

### CPF Nomination
- **Must nominate beneficiaries** - CPF funds don't automatically go to next-of-kin
- **No nomination = Public Trustee** handles distribution (lengthy process)
- **Online nomination**: Via CPF website or SingPass app
- **Can nominate**: Spouse, children, parents, siblings, or anyone

### Distribution Process
**With Valid Nomination**:
- **Fast processing**: 2-4 weeks typically
- **Direct transfer**: Funds go directly to nominated beneficiaries
- **No probate required**: Bypasses court processes
- **Tax-free**: Beneficiaries receive full amount without tax

**Without Nomination**:
- **Public Trustee**: Government agency handles distribution
- **Longer process**: 6-12 months or more
- **Intestacy laws**: Distribution follows legal hierarchy (spouse ‚Üí children ‚Üí parents)
- **Additional costs**: Administrative fees may apply

### What Gets Distributed
- **All CPF balances**: OA + SA + MA + RA
- **Accrued interest**: Up to date of death
- **CPF LIFE**: Remaining balance (if any) after payouts
- **Insurance proceeds**: If bought through CPF
