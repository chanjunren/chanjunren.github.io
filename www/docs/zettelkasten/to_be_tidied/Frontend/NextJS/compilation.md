- e.g. comments/white space

### Bundling
> *Resolving web dependencies and merging files into optimzed bundles for browser*
- Goal: Reduce number of requests when site is visited

### Code Splitting
> *Splitting application bundle into smaller chunks for each entry point*
- Goal: Reduce initial load time by only loading code required to run that page
