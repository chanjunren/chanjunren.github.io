# Rete Algorithm

### Example Scenario
- Imagine you have a rule engine for a pet store, and you're applying the following rules to determine discounts:

    - Rule 1: If a customer buys more than 5 items, they get a 10% discount.
    - Rule 2: If a customer buys more than 10 items, they get a 15% discount.

### Facts
- Customer A buys 4 items.
- Customer B buys 6 items.
- Customer C buys 12 items.

### How Rete Algorithm Works
#### Building the Rete Network 
- When the rules are added to the system, the Rete algorithm constructs a network of nodes.
- These nodes represent the conditions in the rules.
- For our example, there might be nodes that represent the "number of items purchased" condition.

#### Adding Facts
- When a new fact (like a customer purchase) is introduced, it's passed through this network.

#### Nodes Evaluate Facts
- Each node in the network evaluates the fact against its condition. For instance, a node might check, "Is the number of items greater than 5?"

#### Propagation Through the Network
- As the fact moves through the network, only paths where conditions are met are followed. 
    - Customer A (4 items), neither rule is applicable, and the fact doesn't propagate to the action nodes.
    - Customer B (6 items), it meets the condition of Rule 1 but not Rule 2, so it propagates only to the action node of Rule 1.
    - Customer C (12 items), it meets both conditions and propagates to both action nodes.

#### Action Nodes
- At the end of the network are action nodes.
- If a fact reaches an action node, the corresponding action (like applying a discount) is executed.

### Efficiency
The Rete algorithm's strength lies in its ability to remember the outcomes of these condition checks. When a new fact is introduced, or an existing fact changes, not all conditions need to be re-evaluated. This makes it extremely efficient for scenarios where many facts are evaluated against a stable set of rules.
