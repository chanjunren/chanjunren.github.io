## What are SSBs?
- Government-backed bonds designed for individual investors
- **Risk-free** investment fully guaranteed by Singapore Government
- **Step-up interest structure** - rates increase the longer you hold

## Key Features
- **Minimum**: S$500 (in S$500 multiples)
- **Maximum**: S$200,000 per person
- **Tenure**: Up to 10 years
- **Early redemption**: Anytime without penalty
- **Interest payment**: Every 6 months
- **Tax**: Interest is **tax-free**

## Interest Rates (Step-up Structure)
- Rates determined monthly by MAS
- Linked to Singapore Government Securities yields
- Example (Aug 2025 issue):
  - Years 1-3: ~1.82% p.a.
  - Year 10: ~3.09% p.a.
  - 10-year average: ~2.29% p.a.

## Why Consider SSBs?
✅ **Pros:**
- Zero risk (government guarantee)
- Flexible (redeem anytime)
- Tax-free returns
- Higher returns for longer holding periods

❌ **Cons:**
- Lower returns compared to equities/REITs
- Opportunity cost if markets perform well
- Monthly application limits

## What Happens After 10 Years?
- SSBs **automatically mature** at the end of 10 years
- You receive your **full principal** + **final interest payment**
- **If bought with cash**: Money credited to your regular bank account (withdraw freely)
- **If bought with SRS**: Money goes back to your **SRS account** (still locked until age 62)

## SRS Purchase Option
- **Can use SRS funds** to buy SSBs for additional tax benefits
- **Key caveat**: Even after SSB matures, proceeds stay locked in SRS until age 62
- **Trade-off**: Immediate tax relief vs liquidity (locked for 34 years if you're 28)
- **Best for**: Long-term retirement planning only
