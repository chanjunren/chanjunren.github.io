# Morphing & Path Animation in SVG

## Morphing and Path Animation Are Uniquely SVG
- Most animations so far could be done with HTML elements.
- **Morphing shapes or animating paths** is where SVG excels and can't be easily replicated with HTML/CSS alone.

## Animating the `points` Attribute Enables Shape Morphing
- Morphing a `<polyline>` involves changing its `points` attribute.
- This changes the actual shape of the element over time.

## Not All SVG Attributes Are Animatable with CSS
- Only **presentation attributes** (e.g. `fill`, `stroke`) and some **geometry attributes** (e.g. `x`, `y`) are CSS-animatable.
- `points` is **neither**, so CSS can‚Äôt animate it.

## Transform Hacks Don‚Äôt Achieve True Morphing
- Using `transform: rotateX(...)` might create a visual effect but does **not truly morph the shape**.
- These are **workarounds**, not real solutions.

## CSS Has Limitations for SVG Animations
- CSS can't animate most SVG-specific properties.
- For advanced or true morphing animations, CSS alone is **not enough**.

## Two Alternatives to CSS for SVG Animation

| Approach       | Use When...                                                         | Trade-offs                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **SMIL**       | You want **simple, native** SVG animations                          | Limited control, not fully supported in all tools     |
| **JavaScript** | You need **fine-grained control** over timing and shape transitions | More flexible but more complex and potentially slower |
