**Core Concept**: Accept market returns via low-cost index funds rather than trying to beat the market.

## Why It Works

80-90% of active managers underperform benchmarks over 15+ years. Lower fees (0.1-0.3% vs 1-2%) mean more compounds. No research or timing needed.

## Strategy

Buy and hold diversified [[exchange_traded_funds]]:
- Track broad indices (S&P 500, MSCI World, STI)
- Invest regularly 
- Rebalance annually
- Hold decades

**Singapore**: ES3 (STI), CSPX (S&P 500), IWDA (MSCI World), or robo-advisors (Syfe, Endowus, StashAway)

## Trade-offs

**Pros**: Simple, low cost, proven, low stress

**Cons**: Can't outperform market, must endure 20-30% crashes, requires patience

## Best For

Long-term goals (10+ years), busy professionals, beginners, low-stress investors
