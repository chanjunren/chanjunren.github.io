## Origin and Purpose

- A part of the Spring Framework
- Specifically designed for use within Spring applications.
- It provides powerful features for querying and manipulating object graphs at runtime

## Features

- **Integration with Spring:** Seamlessly integrates with Spring beans, allowing for
  - Dynamic evaluation of bean properties, method calls, and more.
- **EL Support:** Supports the standard Unified EL syntax used in JSP and JSF.
- **Templating:** Allows for template expressions to be embedded within strings.
- **Type Conversion:** Built-in support for type conversion and property access.

## Syntax and Usage

- SpEL has a syntax that is an extension of the Unified EL syntax, which makes it familiar to those who have worked with JSP or JSF.
- It supports more advanced features like calling methods, accessing properties, and even working with collections and arrays.

```
ExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser();
Expression exp = parser.parseExpression("'Hello ' + name");

StandardEvaluationContext context = new StandardEvaluationContext();
context.setVariable("name", "World");

String message = (String) exp.getValue(context);

System.out.println(message); // Outputs "Hello World"

```

### Key Differences

1. **Integration and Use Cases:**

   - **MVEL:** Typically used in applications requiring a lightweight, high-performance expression language, such as rule engines and templating engines.
   - **SpEL:** Designed specifically for Spring applications, providing deep integration with Spring's features and infrastructure.

2. **Syntax and Features:**

   - **MVEL:** More concise and dynamic, designed for simplicity and speed.
   - **SpEL:** More powerful in terms of integration with Spring, supports a wider range of features such as method invocation, collection handling, and more.

3. **Performance:**

   - **MVEL:** Generally faster and lighter, suitable for high-performance scenarios.
   - **SpEL:** While powerful and flexible, it may not be as fast as MVEL due to its broader feature set and deeper integration with Spring.

### Summary

- **MVEL** is a general-purpose expression language known for its speed and simplicity, often used in rule engines and templating.
- **SpEL** is tailored for Spring applications, providing powerful features for dynamic property access and method invocation within the Spring context.
- The choice between MVEL and SpEL depends on the specific requirements of your application and whether you need tight integration with Spring features.
