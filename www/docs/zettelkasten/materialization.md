# materialization
- **What it is**: The process of physically creating intermediate results (e.g., temporary tables or data structures) during query execution
    
- **Why it matters**: While sometimes necessary, materialization can be costly in terms of memory and computation
- Deferring it avoids unnecessary data reads or computations, improving efficiency.
