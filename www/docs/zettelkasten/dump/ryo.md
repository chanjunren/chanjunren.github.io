# design questionnaire

## 1. purpose

• what's the one thing people should do or feel?
• what should they remember after they leave?
• if you had to design this in 1 hour, what would you do?

## 2. hierarchy

• what's the most important thing? (this gets 50%+ of visual weight)
• if you could only show 3 things, what would they be?
• what's the natural reading order?

## 3. vibe

• find 3 designs you love and 3 you hate – why?
• what physical space does this feel like? (library, garden, workshop, etc.)
• what emotion are you going for? (calm, playful, focused, etc.)

## 4. constraints

• mobile or desktop or both?
• quick visit or long session?
• daily use or one-time?

## 5. interaction

• fast and snappy or slow and contemplative?
• subtle or bold animations?
• should it feel interactive or like reading?

## 6. style

• what's the tone? (formal, casual, poetic, technical)
• type: warm or cold? organic or geometric?
• color: bright or muted? warm or cool?

## 7. gut check

• what's the simplest version that still works?
• what are you adding because it's "supposed to be there"?
• does this feel like you, or like what design "should" look like?
