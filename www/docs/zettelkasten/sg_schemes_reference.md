## CPF Interest Calculation Deep Dive

### Basic CPF Interest (Compounded Annually)
- **OA**: 2.5% per annum
- **SA/MA/RA**: 4% per annum
- **Compounding**: Interest earned each year is added to principal

### Extra Interest (Under 55)
- **1% extra** on first S$60,000 combined CPF balance
- **OA cap**: Maximum S$20,000 in OA earns extra interest
- **Transfer rule**: Extra interest on OA transferred to SA

### Example CPF Calculation (Age 28)
**Scenario**: S$50,000 in OA, S$30,000 in SA

**OA Interest**:
- First S$20,000: (2.5% + 1%) = 3.5% = S$700
- Remaining S$30,000: 2.5% = S$750
- **Total OA interest**: S$1,450

**SA Interest**:
- First S$30,000: (4% + 1%) = 5% = S$1,500
- **Total SA interest**: S$1,500

**Extra Interest Transfer**: S$700 (extra OA interest) → transferred to SA
**Net Result**: OA gets S$750, SA gets S$1,500 + S$700 = S$2,200
