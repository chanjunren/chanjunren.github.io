##  Active Isometrics

- **How to Perform**:
    - Move into a stretch.
    - Actively hold the position using your muscles.
- **Purpose**:
    - Helps move your _active range_ (controlled by muscles) closer to your _passive range_ (position you can reach with assistance).
    - Builds active strength within your range of motion.
    - Promotes long-term changes in muscle strength and flexibility.

## Slow Controlled Eccentrics

- **How to Perform**:
    - Slowly lower yourself into the desired position.
    - Return to the starting position.
    - Perform for repetitions.
- **Benefits**:
    - Useful as a warm-up.
    - Builds confidence in handling challenging positions.
    - Improves control and strength through the range of motion.

## Contract-Relax Stretching

- **How to Perform**:
    - Actively contract the muscle being stretched (e.g., press into the floor or resist the stretch).
    - Relax and move deeper into the stretch.
- **Benefits**:
    - Enables deeper stretches by overriding the stretch reflex.
- **Variants**:
    - **Contract-Relax Antagonist Contract (CRAC)**:
        - Add an extra layer by tensing the opposing (antagonist) muscle group.
        - Example: While stretching the hamstrings, engage the quadriceps to deepen the stretch.

## Tempo Stretching

- **How to Perform**:
    - Move slowly into the stretch.
    - Pause at the end range of motion.
    - Return to the starting position.
- **Benefits**:
    - Improves control at the end range.
    - Strengthens muscles throughout the range of motion.
    - Can progressively add weight to increase strength and flexibility over time.

## Dynamic Stretching

- **How to Perform**:
    - Incorporate movement into the stretch, usually with higher velocities.
    - Use controlled, rhythmic motions that progressively reach your range of motion.
- **Purpose**:
    - Trains proprioceptors (sensors in muscles and joints that detect position and movement).
    - Prepares the body for flexible positions under dynamic conditions.
    - Ideal for warming up before high-intensity activities.

## Static Passive Stretching

- **How to Perform**:
    - Move into a stretch and hold the position without active muscle engagement.
    - Use external forces (gravity, props, or assistance) to maintain the stretch.
- **Purpose**:
    - Improves overall flexibility.
    - Helps relax the body and muscles.
    - Often used post-workout for recovery.
