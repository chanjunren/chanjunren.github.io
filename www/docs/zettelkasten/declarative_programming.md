# declarative_programming
```ad-summary
Declarative programming focuses on **what** needs to be done rather than **how** to do it

It describes the desired result without specifying the step-by-step process
```

##  Key Principles   
### Separation of Logic and Control
> The programmer defines the logic, and the runtime system handles the control flow
        
### High-Level Abstractions
> Programs are written in terms of domain-specific concepts rather than low-level operations.
        
## Use Cases
- Database queries (e.g., SQL).
- Configuration and markup languages (e.g., HTML, CSS).
- **Examples:** SQL, Prolog, HTML.
