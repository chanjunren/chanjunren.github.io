## What is SRS?
- **Supplementary Retirement Scheme** - voluntary retirement savings scheme
- **Tax benefit**: Contributions reduce your taxable income (up to S$15,300/year for residents)
- **Purpose**: Supplement CPF for retirement planning
- **Voluntary**: Unlike CPF, SRS contributions are optional

## Key Features
- **Annual contribution limit**: S$15,300 for residents, S$35,700 for foreigners
- **Tax relief**: Immediate reduction in taxable income
- **Investment options**: Can invest in approved instruments (stocks, bonds, unit trusts, SSBs, T-Bills)
- **Withdrawal age**: 62 years old (statutory retirement age)
- **Currency**: All investments must be in SGD

## How SRS Works
### Contribution Phase
- **Tax benefit**: Every S$1 contributed reduces taxable income by S$1
- **Example**: Contribute S$15,300 ‚Üí Save ~S$3,060-4,590 in taxes (depending on tax bracket)
- **Timing**: Can contribute anytime during the year, but must be before Dec 31 for that tax year

### Investment Phase
- **Approved investments**: Stocks, bonds, unit trusts, insurance, SSBs, T-Bills
- **Investment gains**: Tax-free while in SRS account
- **Losses**: Investment losses stay within SRS account

### Withdrawal Phase (Age 62+)
- **50% taxable**: Only half of withdrawals are subject to income tax
- **10-year withdrawal period**: Must withdraw all funds within 10 years from age 62
- **Flexibility**: Can choose withdrawal timing and amounts within the 10-year window

## SRS Withdrawal Rules

### Before Age 62 (Early Withdrawal)
- **5% penalty** on withdrawal amount
- **Full income tax** on withdrawn amount (loses original tax benefit)
- **Example**: Withdraw S$10,000 ‚Üí Pay S$500 penalty + ~S$2,000-3,000 tax
- **Why harsh penalties**: Government wants to preserve retirement savings

### After Age 62 (Normal Withdrawal)
- **50% tax-free**: Half of withdrawal is not taxed
- **50% taxable**: Other half taxed at prevailing income tax rates
- **Lower tax burden**: Usually lower tax rates in retirement
- **10-year rule**: Must withdraw everything by age 72

## SRS for Different Investments

### SRS + SSBs
- **Benefits**: Tax relief + guaranteed 2-3% returns
- **Caveat**: Even after SSB matures (10 years), proceeds stay locked in SRS until age 62
- **Best for**: Long-term retirement planning with guaranteed returns

### SRS + Stocks/ETFs
- **Benefits**: Tax relief + potential higher returns
- **Risks**: Can lose money, unlike guaranteed government securities
- **Best for**: Long-term growth with higher risk tolerance

### SRS + T-Bills
- **Benefits**: Tax relief + short-term guaranteed returns (6-12 months)
- **Caveat**: Proceeds stay in SRS account, can't access until 62
- **Best for**: Parking SRS cash short-term while deciding on investments

## Pros & Cons

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- **Immediate tax relief** - reduce current year taxes
- **Tax-free investment gains** - no capital gains tax while in SRS
- **50% tax exemption** at withdrawal (age 62+)
- **Investment flexibility** - wide range of approved instruments
- **Retirement planning** - forces long-term savings discipline

‚ùå **Cons:**
- **Locked until 62** - no liquidity for 34 years (if you're 28)
- **Harsh early withdrawal penalties** - 5% + full tax
- **SGD only** - no foreign currency investments
- **10-year withdrawal rule** - must withdraw all by age 72
- **Investment risk** - can lose money (except government securities)

### SRS Investment Strategy
1. **Conservative**: 100% government securities (SSBs, T-Bills) for guaranteed returns
2. **Balanced**: 70% government securities, 30% diversified ETFs
3. **Aggressive**: 50% government securities, 50% growth stocks/ETFs

### Annual SRS Planning
- **Max contribution**: S$15,300 for maximum tax benefit
- **Timing**: Contribute by Dec 31 for current tax year relief
- **Tax savings**: ~S$3,060-4,590 annually (depending on tax bracket)

## Estate Planning - What Happens Upon Death

### SRS Nomination
- **Must nominate beneficiaries** - SRS funds don't automatically go to next-of-kin
- **Bank-specific process**: Nomination done through your SRS operator (DBS, OCBC, UOB)
- **Different from CPF**: Separate nomination system from CPF
- **Can nominate**: Anyone you choose as beneficiary

### Distribution Process
**With Valid Nomination**:
- **Bank handles distribution**: Your SRS operator processes the claim
- **Faster processing**: 4-8 weeks typically
- **Direct transfer**: Funds go to nominated beneficiaries
- **Investment liquidation**: Investments sold and converted to cash

**Without Nomination**:
- **Intestacy laws apply**: Distribution follows legal hierarchy
- **Probate required**: Court process needed
- **Longer delays**: 6-18 months or more
- **Legal costs**: Probate fees and administrative costs

### Tax Implications Upon Death
- **No early withdrawal penalty**: 5% penalty waived upon death
- **Tax treatment**: Depends on beneficiary's tax situation
- **Investment gains**: Capital gains realized upon liquidation
- **Timing**: Tax implications based on year of distribution

### What Gets Distributed
- **All SRS balances**: Cash + investment holdings
- **Accrued gains/losses**: Current market value of investments
- **Pending transactions**: Any unsettled trades
- **Interest earned**: Up to date of death

### Important Considerations
- **Update nominations**: After major life events (marriage, children, divorce)
- **Coordinate with CPF**: Ensure both CPF and SRS nominations align with estate plan
- **Investment complexity**: Beneficiaries may not understand investment holdings
- **Multiple accounts**: If you have SRS with multiple banks, nominate for each
- **Foreign beneficiaries**: Additional complications if nominating non-residents
