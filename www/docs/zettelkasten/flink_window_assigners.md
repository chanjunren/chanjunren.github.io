- Have both event / processing time flavours
- Tradeoffs
	- Processing:
		- üòÉ Lower latency
		- ‚òπÔ∏è Cannot correctly process historic data
		- ‚òπÔ∏è Cannot handle out of order data
		- ‚òπÔ∏è Non deterministic data


## Count based
| Type     | Description |

- Windows will not fire until a batch is complete
- No option to timeout / process a partial window (except with a custom trigger)

## Global

- Assigns every event (with the same key) to the same global window
- Useful  for custom windowing, with a custom Trigger
```ad-note
Apache flink suggests to use [ProcessFunction](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/learn-flink/event_driven/#process-functions)
```
