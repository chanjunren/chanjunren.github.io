## Transcoding Decision Matrix

### **Always Transcode**
- **Multiple device support** (mobile + desktop)  
- **Varying network conditions** (3G vs fiber)  
- **Global audience** (different bandwidth)  
- **User experience priority** (smooth playback)  

## Size-Based Guidelines

| Video Size | Strategy | Reasoning |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| < 50MB | Transcode if frequently viewed | Processing cost vs benefit |
| 50-200MB | Almost always transcode | Sweet spot for quality benefits |
| > 200MB | Definitely transcode | Huge UX impact |

### **Factors More Important Than Size**

#### **Audience Reach**
- Wide audience → **Transcode**
- Internal only → **Maybe skip**

#### **Content Type**
- Marketing videos → **Transcode**
- Debug recordings → **Skip**

#### **Expected Views**
- High traffic → **Transcode immediately**
- Low traffic → **Transcode on demand**

#### **Original Quality**
- High bitrate source → **Definitely transcode**
- Already optimized → **Maybe skip**

### **Practical Examples**

#### **Always Transcode:**
```
✅ Product demos (viewed on all devices)
✅ Educational content (global audience)
✅ Marketing videos (performance critical)
✅ Live recordings (usually high bitrate)
```

#### **Consider Skipping:**
```
❌ Internal meeting recordings
❌ Debug/test videos  
❌ Already mobile-optimized uploads
❌ Very short clips (< 30 seconds)
```

### **Smart Transcoding Strategy**
1. **Create 720p immediately** (fast processing, covers most needs)
2. **Create other qualities based on viewership** (data-driven approach)
3. **Use analytics to guide priorities** (transcode what actually gets watched)
