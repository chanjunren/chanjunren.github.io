# data_federation
> **Data Federation** is the technique of **querying and integrating data from multiple, distributed sources** (databases, data lakes, APIs, etc.) **as if they were a single source** ‚Äî **without physically moving or copying the data**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (High-Level)
Instead of ETL-ing all data into one place:
- A **federated engine** sits on top of the data sources
- When a query comes in, it:
    1. Breaks it into subqueries
    2. Sends subqueries to each data source
    3. Aggregates the results
    4. Returns a unified response

## üíº When to Use It

| Use Case                                 | Why Data Federation Helps                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Data is spread across services/databases | Avoids centralization or duplication        |
| Need fast insights across systems        | Real-time querying without pre-aggregation  |
| Can't move data due to compliance        | Leaves data _in-place_ (good for GDPR etc.) |
## ‚úÖ Pros
- No need to duplicate data
- Real-time / near real-time access
- Flexible for ad-hoc queries
- Good for hybrid/multi-cloud environments
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons
- **Performance** depends on underlying sources
- **Complexity** in query planning and optimization
- **Limited joins** across incompatible systems
- **Latency** can be high if sources are slow or far apart
