# imperative_programming
```ad-summary
Imperative programming focuses on describing **how** a program operates, using statements that change the program's state.
```
    
## Key Principles
    
### Mutable State
> Variables and data structures can be modified during execution

### Control Structures
> Uses loops, conditionals, and sequences to control program flow

## Use Cases
- General-purpose programming.
- Systems programming (e.g., operating systems, device drivers).
- **Examples:** 
	- C
	- Python (supports both imperative and OOP).
