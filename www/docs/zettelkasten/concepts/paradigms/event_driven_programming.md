# event_driven_programming
```ad-summary
Event-driven programming focuses on responding to events (e.g., user actions, sensor inputs) by triggering event handlers or callbacks.
```
    
## Key Principles
    
### Event Loop
> A central mechanism that listens for events and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers
        
### Asynchronous Execution
> Programs do not block while waiting for events, enabling responsiveness.
        
## Use Cases:
- Graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- Real-time systems (e.g., IoT devices, gaming).
- **Examples:** 
	- JavaScript (in browsers)
	- Node.js
	- GUI frameworks like Qt
