# netty

_A high-performance, event-driven networking framework based on Java NIO_

- A **non-blocking, asynchronous** networking framework for Java.
- Designed for **high-performance** network applications (e.g., RPC, proxies, microservices).
- Used for **TCP, UDP, HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC** and other protocols.
- Improves **scalability, performance, and usability** over raw Java NIO.

## Core Concepts

### EventLoop Model
- **Event-driven architecture**: Network events (read, write, connect) are handled asynchronously.
- **Threading Model**:
    - **Boss Group**: Accepts connections.
    - **Worker Group**: Handles I/O for connections.
    - Each `EventLoop` is assigned to a `Channel`.

### Channel

- Represents a **network connection** (like a socket).
- Supports **non-blocking** reads and writes.

### ChannelPipeline

- **Ordered list of handlers** attached to a `Channel`.
- Processes **inbound (received) and outbound (sent) data**.
- Data flows through a **decoder -> business logic -> encoder** pattern.

### ChannelHandler

- Modular component for handling network events.
- Two types:
    - **Inbound Handler**: Processes received data.
    - **Outbound Handler**: Transforms and writes data.

### ByteBuf
- **Netty's buffer implementation** (replaces `ByteBuffer`).
- Supports **zero-copy**, slicing, pooling, and direct memory access.
- Avoids Java NIO's `ByteBuffer` limitations.

### Bootstrap & ServerBootstrap

- Used to **configure and start Netty applications**.
- `Bootstrap`: For clients.
- `ServerBootstrap`: For servers.

### Future & Promise

- **Asynchronous operation results**.
- `Future`: Represents an operation‚Äôs result (can be polled).
- `Promise`: Allows manual result setting.

## Data Flow in Netty

### Inbound (Reading Data)
1. **Channel reads data** from the socket.
2. **ByteBuf stores raw bytes**.
3. **Decoder transforms bytes** into structured messages.
4. **Handlers process the message**.
5. Application logic executes.

### Outbound (Writing Data)
1. Application triggers an operation.
2. **Handlers process and transform** the message.
3. **Encoder converts** structured messages to bytes.
4. **ByteBuf sends bytes** to the socket.

## **4. Netty's Key Architectural Components**

| Component            | Function                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Channel**          | Represents a network connection.  |
| **EventLoop**        | Manages I/O events for a Channel. |
| **ChannelPipeline**  | Manages handlers for a Channel.   |
| **ChannelHandler**   | Processes network events.         |
| **ByteBuf**          | Efficient memory buffer for data. |
| **Bootstrap**        | Configures client/server startup. |
| **Future & Promise** | Handles asynchronous operations.  |

## Threading Model
- Uses **EventLoopGroups** to manage threads.
- **BossGroup** (Single thread) handles **incoming connections**.
- **WorkerGroup** (Multiple threads) handles **I/O operations**.
- Uses **epoll/kqueue** for efficient event handling.

## Netty vs Java NIO vs Java IO

|Feature|Netty|Java NIO|Java IO (Blocking)|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Asynchronous**|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|‚ùå No|
|**Thread Efficiency**|‚úÖ High|‚úÖ Medium|‚ùå Low|
|**Memory Management**|‚úÖ Pooled Buffers|‚ùå Manual Buffers|‚ùå Heap Buffers|
|**Ease of Use**|‚úÖ Simple|‚ùå Complex|‚úÖ Simple|
|**Performance**|‚úÖ High|‚úÖ Medium|‚ùå Low|

## Advantages of Netty

- **Simplifies Java NIO complexity**.
- **High concurrency** with event-driven architecture.
- **Efficient memory management** via pooled buffers.
- **Optimized threading model** with shared event loops.
- **Supports multiple protocols**.

## Common Use Cases

- **High-performance web servers** (Spring WebFlux, Netty-based HTTP servers).
- **Messaging frameworks** (gRPC, Kafka).
- **Game servers** (real-time communication).
- **Reverse proxies & load balancers**.
- **Microservices communication**.
