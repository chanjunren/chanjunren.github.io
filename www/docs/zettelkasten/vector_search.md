# vector_search
> **Vector search** is a technique for finding **similar items** based on **numerical vector representations** (aka embeddings) of data, instead of doing keyword or exact-match lookups.

## 🔍 Why Use Vector Search?
Traditional search:
- Looks for **exact keyword matches**
- Doesn't understand **meaning or context**
Vector search:
- Finds items that are **semantically similar**, even if the words used are different

## 💡 How It Works (Simplified)
1. **Convert data to vectors (embeddings)**
    - e.g. a sentence like "I love pizza" → `[0.3, -0.7, 0.1, ...]`
2. **Store all vectors** in a special database or index
3. When you query (e.g. "best food"),
    - it’s also converted into a vector
## 🧭 Common Use Cases

| Use Case                            | Description                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Semantic Search**              | Search documents/images by meaning, not exact words |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Recommendation Systems** | Find similar products/users based on embeddings     |
| 🧠 **AI Chatbots / RAG**            | Retrieve relevant knowledge chunks before answering |
| 🖼️ **Image Search**                | Find visually similar images                        |
| 🧬 **Genomics**                     | Compare DNA embeddings                              |

## 🛠️ Tools / Frameworks for Vector Search

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|**FAISS** (Meta)|Fast indexing of vectors (C++/Python)|
|**Annoy** (Spotify)|Approximate Nearest Neighbor in Rust|
|**Milvus / Qdrant**|Scalable vector DBs with APIs|
|**Weaviate**|Full-featured vector DB with modules|
|**Pinecone**|Managed vector DB service|
|**Elasticsearch + kNN**|Vector plugin for hybrid search|

## ✅ Pros
- Understands **semantics**, not just keywords
- Enables **fuzzy**, context-aware search
- Great for **unstructured data**: text, images, audio, etc.

## ⚠️ Cons
- Slower than keyword search (but getting faster!)
- Needs **preprocessing**: embedding generation
- **Scalability** and **freshness** challenges with large data

### 🧠 Vector Search vs Keyword Search

| Keyword Search | Vector Search          |                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Based on       | Exact words            | Semantic meaning                      |
| Example Query  | "red shoes"            | "comfortable running gear"            |
| Finds          | Pages with "red shoes" | Pages about sneakers or running shoes |
| Under the hood | Inverted index         | Vector similarity (ANN)               |
