## Phase 1 - Imagination
> Goal setting and strategic planning
### The Dream
- Establishes "the forest" (forgot to record what this is )
- Emotional catalyst for change
- Gets you out of bed

```ad-quote
"A dream is not enough, you need a plan" - Bob Bowman
```
### The plan
- Specific objectives
- Clearly defined timeframe
- Roadmap for the journey


| Type        | Timeframe    | Description                  |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Dream       | 5 - 10 years | General and broad            |
| Mid Range   | 1 - 4 years  | Specific but flexible        |
| Short Range | 6 months     | Very specific and measurable |
| Immediate   | Right now    | The key to success           |

### Performance planning
1. Write down specific target
2. Specify timeframe
3. Identify objectives
4. Visualize success
> Running a movie of yourself attaining your goals, be as vivid (details about the event) as possible
5. Rehearse everyday 
> Practise the small things the way it should be done, what you can do **today** that will lead you to your long term goals

## Phase 2 - Challenge
> Daily implementation, adjustments to plan

> Attitude is everything; Ordeal or adventure? Upz to u

Focus on the process - it is more important than any outcome

### Attitude
```ad-quote
"Don't look at the scoreboard; play the next play" - Nick Saban

```
- Process Goals - specific objectives
- Outcome Goals - the long term goals (e.g. winning sth)
- When performing anything, there is a physical / mental aspect
- Maximum performance point - You perform best when you are in the middle of thinking about these two type of goals
	- Thinking about process goals - can make you lethargic
	- Thinking about outcome goals - can make you nervous
	- Must balance
	- Can control this by thinking about process / outcome goals
	
```ad-quote
"There can be no growth without discontent" - Lou Tice

###  Overcoming obstacles

```ad-quote

```

## Phase 3 - High Performance
> Breakthrough, evaluation, refocus
### Details matter
- Focus on small things that have a big impact
- Insist on doing them right everytime
- Think of the details that can help you improve

```ad-quote
"High performance is a natural outcome of all your small decisions"
```
