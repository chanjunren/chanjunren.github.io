# view
> A virtual table that represents the result of a predefined query
- It does **not** store data physically
- Dynamically retrieves data from underlying tables or views when queried
        
## Use Cases
- Simplifying complex queries by encapsulating them in a reusable view
- Providing a **restricted** or **aggregated** view of data to users without exposing the underlying tables

```ad-example
Creating a view that shows only active users from a larger user table
```
