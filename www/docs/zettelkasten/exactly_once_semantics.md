# exactly_once_semantics

```ad-abstract
In the context of stream-processing, it Means that 
```

## Definition 
- Each piece of data (event) in a stream is processed **exactly one time** even in the presence of failures like node crashes or network interruptions
- Ensures that the state of the application and the results are correct, consistent, and not duplicated or lost.


## Why Exactly-Once Semantics Matters

1. **Correctness**:
    
    - In applications like financial transactions, order processing, or user analytics, processing data multiple times or losing data can lead to incorrect results.
    - For example, counting a purchase twice or missing a user action could have significant consequences.
2. **Fault Tolerance**:
    
    - Stream processing systems like Flink operate in distributed environments, where failures (e.g., machine crashes, network issues) are common. Exactly-once semantics ensures consistency even in such scenarios.
