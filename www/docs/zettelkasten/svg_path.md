# svg_path
- The `path` element lets you draw any shape you can think of by using a _series of commands_.
- Each command is a _letter_ followed by a _list of numbers_.
- The _cursor_ is the "pen" that is used to draw the path from the list of commands. Each command relies on it to know where it should start drawing from, and each command moves it to a new position.
- Each command has a _relative_ counterpart that uses coordinates relative to the _cursor_'s current position.

At this point, we kinda know the basics, but we haven't actually drawn anything. In the next section, we'll take a look at some of the drawing commands to start making some icons!
