```ad-summary
Logic programming is based on formal logic, where programs consist of a set of logical rules and facts

The program infers solutions based on these rules
```

## Key Principles
    
### Declarative Nature
> Focuses on describing the problem rather than specifying the solution
        
### Pattern Matching
> Uses pattern matching to derive answers from logical rules
        
## Use Cases:
- Artificial intelligence and expert systems.
- Symbolic computation and theorem proving.
- **Examples:** 
	- Prolog
	- Datalog
