# Zettelkasten: atomic notes for learning and reference

## Structure
- Template: 🗓️ created datetime (DDMMYYYY HHmm), h1 title, content, References
- Filename = h1 title (snake_case)
- One atomic concept per note
- Organized by topic subdirectories (backend, frontend, infrastructure, etc.)

## Writing Style
- **Core Concept**: Point form bullets when multiple aspects, one sentence if single aspect
- Structure: **Core Concept → Why → When to Use → Trade-offs**
- Short sentences. Bullets. No fluff. Cut ruthlessly.
- Minimize analogies (only if genuinely clarifying)
- Focus on concepts, not code (unless cheatsheet requested)

## Content Requirements

**Must have:**
- Core Concept
- Why it matters (1-2 sentences)
- When to use / when not to use
- Trade-offs

**Optional:**
- Key distinctions (A vs B)
- Common pitfalls
- Comparisons
- Common patterns (conceptual only)

**Only if user asks for cheatsheet:**
- Quick Reference (syntax/code examples)
- Implementation examples
- Configuration snippets

**Forbidden:**
- Excessive analogies or mental models
- Historical background (unless explains WHY)
- Code examples (unless cheatsheet requested)
- Obvious explanations

## Linking
- Link inline with explicit relationship: "This builds on [[prerequisite]] because..."
- NO "Related Concepts" sections
- Link only when: prerequisite, contrast, or logical next step

## Formatting
- h2-h3 for sections
- Bold key terms on first mention
- Tables for comparisons
- Admonitions sparingly (max 2): `ad-warning`, `ad-danger`, `ad-example`

## Accuracy
- Verify facts before writing
- Search credible sources when uncertain
- Only link to notes that exist
- Cite sources for complex information
