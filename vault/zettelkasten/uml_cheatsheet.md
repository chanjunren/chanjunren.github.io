## Association vs Dependency
- An association is a relationship resulting from one object keeping a reference to another object (i.e., storing an object in an instance variable)
- While such a relationship forms a _dependency_, we need not show that as a dependency arrow in the class diagram if the association is already indicated in the diagram
- That is, showing a dependency arrow does not add any value to the diagram.
